chapter
i
you
know
about
me
without
you
have
read
a
book
by
the
name
of
the
adventures
of
tom
sawyer
but
that
no
matter
that
book
was
made
by
mr
mark
twain
and
he
told
the
truth
mainly
there
was
things
which
he
stretched
but
mainly
he
told
the
truth
that
is
nothing
i
never
seen
anybody
but
lied
one
time
or
another
without
it
was
aunt
polly
or
the
widow
or
maybe
mary
aunt
polly
aunt
polly
she
is
and
mary
and
the
widow
douglas
is
all
told
about
in
that
book
which
is
mostly
a
true
book
with
some
stretchers
as
i
said
before
now
the
way
that
the
book
winds
up
is
this
tom
and
me
found
the
money
that
the
robbers
hid
in
the
cave
and
it
made
us
rich
we
got
six
thousand
dollars
apiece
all
gold
it
was
an
awful
sight
of
money
when
it
was
piled
up
well
judge
thatcher
he
took
it
and
put
it
out
at
interest
and
it
fetched
us
a
dollar
a
day
apiece
all
the
year
round
more
than
a
body
could
tell
what
to
do
with
the
widow
douglas
she
took
me
for
her
son
and
allowed
she
would
sivilize
me
but
it
was
rough
living
in
the
house
all
the
time
considering
how
dismal
regular
and
decent
the
widow
was
in
all
her
ways
and
so
when
i
stand
it
no
longer
i
lit
out
i
got
into
my
old
rags
and
my
again
and
was
free
and
satisfied
but
tom
sawyer
he
hunted
me
up
and
said
he
was
going
to
start
a
band
of
robbers
and
i
might
join
if
i
would
go
back
to
the
widow
and
be
respectable
so
i
went
back
the
widow
she
cried
over
me
and
called
me
a
poor
lost
lamb
and
she
called
me
a
lot
of
other
names
too
but
she
never
meant
no
harm
by
it
she
put
me
in
them
new
clothes
again
and
i
do
nothing
but
sweat
and
sweat
and
feel
all
cramped
up
well
then
the
old
thing
commenced
again
the
widow
rung
a
bell
for
supper
and
you
had
to
come
to
time
when
you
got
to
the
table
you
go
right
to
eating
but
you
had
to
wait
for
the
widow
to
tuck
down
her
head
and
grumble
a
little
over
the
victuals
though
there
really
anything
the
matter
with
them
that
is
nothing
only
everything
was
cooked
by
itself
in
a
barrel
of
odds
and
ends
it
is
different
things
get
mixed
up
and
the
juice
kind
of
swaps
around
and
the
things
go
better
after
supper
she
got
out
her
book
and
learned
me
about
moses
and
the
bulrushers
and
i
was
in
a
sweat
to
find
out
all
about
him
but
by
and
by
she
let
it
out
that
moses
had
been
dead
a
considerable
long
time
so
then
i
care
no
more
about
him
because
i
take
no
stock
in
dead
people
pretty
soon
i
wanted
to
smoke
and
asked
the
widow
to
let
me
but
she
she
said
it
was
a
mean
practice
and
clean
and
i
must
try
to
not
do
it
any
more
that
is
just
the
way
with
some
people
they
get
down
on
a
thing
when
they
know
nothing
about
it
here
she
was
about
moses
which
was
no
kin
to
her
and
no
use
to
anybody
being
gone
you
see
yet
finding
a
power
of
fault
with
me
for
doing
a
thing
that
had
some
good
in
it
and
she
took
snuff
too
of
course
that
was
all
right
because
she
done
it
herself
her
sister
miss
watson
a
tolerable
slim
old
maid
with
goggles
on
had
just
come
to
live
with
her
and
took
a
set
at
me
now
with
a
she
worked
me
middling
hard
for
about
an
hour
and
then
the
widow
made
her
ease
up
i
stood
it
much
longer
then
for
an
hour
it
was
deadly
dull
and
i
was
fidgety
miss
watson
would
say
put
your
feet
up
there
huckleberry
and
scrunch
up
like
that
huckleberry
set
up
straight
and
pretty
soon
she
would
say
gap
and
stretch
like
that
huckleberry
why
you
try
to
behave
then
she
told
me
all
about
the
bad
place
and
i
said
i
wished
i
was
there
she
got
mad
then
but
i
mean
no
harm
all
i
wanted
was
to
go
somewheres
all
i
wanted
was
a
change
i
particular
she
said
it
was
wicked
to
say
what
i
said
said
she
say
it
for
the
whole
world
she
was
going
to
live
so
as
to
go
to
the
good
place
well
i
see
no
advantage
in
going
where
she
was
going
so
i
made
up
my
mind
i
try
for
it
but
i
never
said
so
because
it
would
only
make
trouble
and
do
no
good
now
she
had
got
a
start
and
she
went
on
and
told
me
all
about
the
good
place
she
said
all
a
body
would
have
to
do
there
was
to
go
around
all
day
long
with
a
harp
and
sing
forever
and
ever
so
i
think
much
of
it
but
i
never
said
so
i
asked
her
if
she
reckoned
tom
sawyer
would
go
there
and
she
said
not
by
a
considerable
sight
i
was
glad
about
that
because
i
wanted
him
and
me
to
be
together
miss
watson
she
kept
pecking
at
me
and
it
got
tiresome
and
lonesome
by
and
by
they
fetched
the
niggers
in
and
had
prayers
and
then
everybody
was
off
to
bed
i
went
up
to
my
room
with
a
piece
of
candle
and
put
it
on
the
table
then
i
set
down
in
a
chair
by
the
window
and
tried
to
think
of
something
cheerful
but
it
no
use
i
felt
so
lonesome
i
most
wished
i
was
dead
the
stars
were
shining
and
the
leaves
rustled
in
the
woods
ever
so
mournful
and
i
heard
an
owl
away
off
about
somebody
that
was
dead
and
a
whippowill
and
a
dog
crying
about
somebody
that
was
going
to
die
and
the
wind
was
trying
to
whisper
something
to
me
and
i
make
out
what
it
was
and
so
it
made
the
cold
shivers
run
over
me
then
away
out
in
the
woods
i
heard
that
kind
of
a
sound
that
a
ghost
makes
when
it
wants
to
tell
about
something
on
its
mind
and
make
itself
understood
and
so
rest
easy
in
its
grave
and
has
to
go
about
that
way
every
night
grieving
i
got
so
and
scared
i
did
wish
i
had
some
company
pretty
soon
a
spider
went
crawling
up
my
shoulder
and
i
flipped
it
off
and
it
lit
in
the
candle
and
before
i
could
budge
it
was
all
shriveled
up
i
need
anybody
to
tell
me
that
that
was
an
awful
bad
sign
and
would
fetch
me
some
bad
luck
so
i
was
scared
and
most
shook
the
clothes
off
of
me
i
got
up
and
turned
around
in
my
tracks
three
times
and
crossed
my
breast
every
time
and
then
i
tied
up
a
little
lock
of
my
hair
with
a
thread
to
keep
witches
away
but
i
no
confidence
you
do
that
when
lost
a
horseshoe
that
found
instead
of
nailing
it
up
over
the
door
but
i
ever
heard
anybody
say
it
was
any
way
to
keep
off
bad
luck
when
killed
a
spider
i
set
down
again
all
over
and
got
out
my
pipe
for
a
smoke
for
the
house
was
all
as
still
as
death
now
and
so
the
widow
know
well
after
a
long
time
i
heard
the
clock
away
off
in
the
town
go
boom
boom
boom
twelve
licks
and
all
still
again
stiller
than
ever
pretty
soon
i
heard
a
twig
snap
down
in
the
dark
amongst
the
trees
something
was
a
stirring
i
set
still
and
listened
directly
i
could
just
barely
hear
a
down
there
that
was
good
says
i
as
soft
as
i
could
and
then
i
put
out
the
light
and
scrambled
out
of
the
window
on
to
the
shed
then
i
slipped
down
to
the
ground
and
crawled
in
among
the
trees
and
sure
enough
there
was
tom
sawyer
waiting
for
me
chapter
ii
we
went
tiptoeing
along
a
path
amongst
the
trees
back
towards
the
end
of
the
garden
stooping
down
so
as
the
branches
scrape
our
heads
when
we
was
passing
by
the
kitchen
i
fell
over
a
root
and
made
a
noise
we
scrouched
down
and
laid
still
miss
big
nigger
named
jim
was
setting
in
the
kitchen
door
we
could
see
him
pretty
clear
because
there
was
a
light
behind
him
he
got
up
and
stretched
his
neck
out
about
a
minute
listening
then
he
says
who
dah
he
listened
some
more
then
he
come
tiptoeing
down
and
stood
right
between
us
we
could
a
touched
him
nearly
well
likely
it
was
minutes
and
minutes
that
there
a
sound
and
we
all
there
so
close
together
there
was
a
place
on
my
ankle
that
got
to
itching
but
i
scratch
it
and
then
my
ear
begun
to
itch
and
next
my
back
right
between
my
shoulders
seemed
like
die
if
i
scratch
well
noticed
that
thing
plenty
times
since
if
you
are
with
the
quality
or
at
a
funeral
or
trying
to
go
to
sleep
when
you
sleepy
if
you
are
anywheres
where
it
do
for
you
to
scratch
why
you
will
itch
all
over
in
upwards
of
a
thousand
places
pretty
soon
jim
says
say
who
is
you
whar
is
you
dog
my
cats
ef
i
hear
well
i
know
what
gwyne
to
do
gwyne
to
set
down
here
and
listen
tell
i
hears
it
agin
so
he
set
down
on
the
ground
betwixt
me
and
tom
he
leaned
his
back
up
against
a
tree
and
stretched
his
legs
out
till
one
of
them
most
touched
one
of
mine
my
nose
begun
to
itch
it
itched
till
the
tears
come
into
my
eyes
but
i
scratch
then
it
begun
to
itch
on
the
inside
next
i
got
to
itching
underneath
i
know
how
i
was
going
to
set
still
this
miserableness
went
on
as
much
as
six
or
seven
minutes
but
it
seemed
a
sight
longer
than
that
i
was
itching
in
eleven
different
places
now
i
reckoned
i
stand
it
a
minute
longer
but
i
set
my
teeth
hard
and
got
ready
to
try
just
then
jim
begun
to
breathe
heavy
next
he
begun
to
snore
and
then
i
was
pretty
soon
comfortable
again
tom
he
made
a
sign
to
me
kind
of
a
little
noise
with
his
mouth
and
we
went
creeping
away
on
our
hands
and
knees
when
we
was
ten
foot
off
tom
whispered
to
me
and
wanted
to
tie
jim
to
the
tree
for
fun
but
i
said
no
he
might
wake
and
make
a
disturbance
and
then
find
out
i
in
then
tom
said
he
got
candles
enough
and
he
would
slip
in
the
kitchen
and
get
some
more
i
want
him
to
try
i
said
jim
might
wake
up
and
come
but
tom
wanted
to
resk
it
so
we
slid
in
there
and
got
three
candles
and
tom
laid
five
cents
on
the
table
for
pay
then
we
got
out
and
i
was
in
a
sweat
to
get
away
but
nothing
would
do
tom
but
he
must
crawl
to
where
jim
was
on
his
hands
and
knees
and
play
something
on
him
i
waited
and
it
seemed
a
good
while
everything
was
so
still
and
lonesome
as
soon
as
tom
was
back
we
cut
along
the
path
around
the
garden
fence
and
by
and
by
fetched
up
on
the
steep
top
of
the
hill
the
other
side
of
the
house
tom
said
he
slipped
hat
off
of
his
head
and
hung
it
on
a
limb
right
over
him
and
jim
stirred
a
little
but
he
wake
afterwards
jim
said
the
witches
be
witched
him
and
put
him
in
a
trance
and
rode
him
all
over
the
state
and
then
set
him
under
the
trees
again
and
hung
his
hat
on
a
limb
to
show
who
done
it
and
next
time
jim
told
it
he
said
they
rode
him
down
to
new
orleans
and
after
that
every
time
he
told
it
he
spread
it
more
and
more
till
by
and
by
he
said
they
rode
him
all
over
the
world
and
tired
him
most
to
death
and
his
back
was
all
over
jim
was
monstrous
proud
about
it
and
he
got
so
he
hardly
notice
the
other
niggers
niggers
would
come
miles
to
hear
jim
tell
about
it
and
he
was
more
looked
up
to
than
any
nigger
in
that
country
strange
niggers
would
stand
with
their
mouths
open
and
look
him
all
over
same
as
if
he
was
a
wonder
niggers
is
always
talking
about
witches
in
the
dark
by
the
kitchen
fire
but
whenever
one
was
talking
and
letting
on
to
know
all
about
such
things
jim
would
happen
in
and
say
hm
what
you
know
witches
and
that
nigger
was
corked
up
and
had
to
take
a
back
seat
jim
always
kept
that
piece
round
his
neck
with
a
string
and
said
it
was
a
charm
the
devil
give
to
him
with
his
own
hands
and
told
him
he
could
cure
anybody
with
it
and
fetch
witches
whenever
he
wanted
to
just
by
saying
something
to
it
but
he
never
told
what
it
was
he
said
to
it
niggers
would
come
from
all
around
there
and
give
jim
anything
they
had
just
for
a
sight
of
that
piece
but
they
touch
it
because
the
devil
had
had
his
hands
on
it
jim
was
most
ruined
for
a
servant
because
he
got
stuck
up
on
account
of
having
seen
the
devil
and
been
rode
by
witches
well
when
tom
and
me
got
to
the
edge
of
the
hilltop
we
looked
away
down
into
the
village
and
could
see
three
or
four
lights
twinkling
where
there
was
sick
folks
maybe
and
the
stars
over
us
was
sparkling
ever
so
fine
and
down
by
the
village
was
the
river
a
whole
mile
broad
and
awful
still
and
grand
we
went
down
the
hill
and
found
jo
harper
and
ben
rogers
and
two
or
three
more
of
the
boys
hid
in
the
old
tanyard
so
we
unhitched
a
skiff
and
pulled
down
the
river
two
mile
and
a
half
to
the
big
scar
on
the
hillside
and
went
ashore
we
went
to
a
clump
of
bushes
and
tom
made
everybody
swear
to
keep
the
secret
and
then
showed
them
a
hole
in
the
hill
right
in
the
thickest
part
of
the
bushes
then
we
lit
the
candles
and
crawled
in
on
our
hands
and
knees
we
went
about
two
hundred
yards
and
then
the
cave
opened
up
tom
poked
about
amongst
the
passages
and
pretty
soon
ducked
under
a
wall
where
you
a
noticed
that
there
was
a
hole
we
went
along
a
narrow
place
and
got
into
a
kind
of
room
all
damp
and
sweaty
and
cold
and
there
we
stopped
tom
says
now
start
this
band
of
robbers
and
call
it
tom
gang
everybody
that
wants
to
join
has
got
to
take
an
oath
and
write
his
name
in
blood
everybody
was
willing
so
tom
got
out
a
sheet
of
paper
that
he
had
wrote
the
oath
on
and
read
it
it
swore
every
boy
to
stick
to
the
band
and
never
tell
any
of
the
secrets
and
if
anybody
done
anything
to
any
boy
in
the
band
whichever
boy
was
ordered
to
kill
that
person
and
his
family
must
do
it
and
he
eat
and
he
sleep
till
he
had
killed
them
and
hacked
a
cross
in
their
breasts
which
was
the
sign
of
the
band
and
nobody
that
belong
to
the
band
could
use
that
mark
and
if
he
did
he
must
be
sued
and
if
he
done
it
again
he
must
be
killed
and
if
anybody
that
belonged
to
the
band
told
the
secrets
he
must
have
his
throat
cut
and
then
have
his
carcass
burnt
up
and
the
ashes
scattered
all
around
and
his
name
blotted
off
of
the
list
with
blood
and
never
mentioned
again
by
the
gang
but
have
a
curse
put
on
it
and
be
forgot
forever
everybody
said
it
was
a
real
beautiful
oath
and
asked
tom
if
he
got
it
out
of
his
own
head
he
said
some
of
it
but
the
rest
was
out
of
and
and
every
gang
that
was
had
it
some
thought
it
would
be
good
to
kill
the
families
of
boys
that
told
the
secrets
tom
said
it
was
a
good
idea
so
he
took
a
pencil
and
wrote
it
in
then
ben
rogers
says
huck
finn
he
got
no
family
what
you
going
to
do
him
well
he
got
a
father
says
tom
sawyer
yes
got
a
father
but
you
never
find
him
these
days
he
used
to
lay
drunk
with
the
hogs
in
the
tanyard
but
he
been
seen
in
these
parts
for
a
year
or
more
they
talked
it
over
and
they
was
going
to
rule
me
out
because
they
said
every
boy
must
have
a
family
or
somebody
to
kill
or
else
it
be
fair
and
square
for
the
others
well
nobody
could
think
of
anything
to
do
everybody
was
stumped
and
set
still
i
was
most
ready
to
cry
but
all
at
once
i
thought
of
a
way
and
so
i
offered
them
miss
watson
they
could
kill
her
everybody
said
oh
do
all
right
huck
can
come
in
then
they
all
stuck
a
pin
in
their
fingers
to
get
blood
to
sign
with
and
i
made
my
mark
on
the
paper
now
says
ben
rogers
the
line
of
business
of
this
gang
nothing
only
robbery
and
murder
tom
said
but
who
are
we
going
to
rob
houses
or
cattle
or
stuff
stealing
cattle
and
such
things
robbery
burglary
says
tom
sawyer
we
burglars
that
no
sort
of
style
we
are
highwaymen
we
stop
stages
and
carriages
on
the
road
with
masks
on
and
kill
the
people
and
take
their
watches
and
money
must
we
always
kill
the
people
oh
certainly
best
some
authorities
think
different
but
mostly
considered
best
to
kill
them
except
some
that
you
bring
to
the
cave
here
and
keep
them
till
ransomed
ransomed
that
i
know
but
what
they
do
seen
it
in
books
and
so
of
course
what
got
to
do
but
how
can
we
do
it
if
we
know
what
it
is
why
blame
it
all
got
to
do
it
i
tell
you
in
the
books
do
you
want
to
go
to
doing
different
from
in
the
books
and
get
things
all
muddled
up
oh
all
very
fine
to
say
tom
sawyer
but
how
in
the
nation
are
these
fellows
going
to
be
ransomed
if
we
know
how
to
do
it
to
them
the
thing
i
want
to
get
at
now
what
do
you
reckon
it
is
well
i
know
but
if
we
keep
them
till
ransomed
it
means
that
we
keep
them
till
dead
now
something
like
answer
why
you
said
that
before
keep
them
till
ransomed
to
death
and
a
bothersome
lot
be
too
eating
up
everything
and
always
trying
to
get
loose
how
you
talk
ben
rogers
how
can
they
get
loose
when
a
guard
over
them
ready
to
shoot
them
down
if
they
move
a
peg
a
guard
well
that
is
good
so
got
to
set
up
all
night
and
never
get
any
sleep
just
so
as
to
watch
them
i
think
foolishness
why
a
body
take
a
club
and
ransom
them
as
soon
as
they
get
here
because
it
in
the
books
so
why
now
ben
rogers
do
you
want
to
do
things
regular
or
you
the
idea
you
reckon
that
the
people
that
made
the
books
knows
the
correct
thing
to
do
do
you
reckon
you
can
learn
anything
not
by
a
good
deal
no
sir
just
go
on
and
ransom
them
in
the
regular
way
all
right
i
mind
but
i
say
a
fool
way
anyhow
say
do
we
kill
the
women
too
well
ben
rogers
if
i
was
as
ignorant
as
you
i
let
on
kill
the
women
no
nobody
ever
saw
anything
in
the
books
like
that
you
fetch
them
to
the
cave
and
always
as
polite
as
pie
to
them
and
by
and
by
they
fall
in
love
with
you
and
never
want
to
go
home
any
more
well
if
the
way
agreed
but
i
take
no
stock
in
it
mighty
soon
have
the
cave
so
cluttered
up
with
women
and
fellows
waiting
to
be
ransomed
that
there
be
no
place
for
the
robbers
but
go
ahead
i
got
nothing
to
say
little
tommy
barnes
was
asleep
now
and
when
they
waked
him
up
he
was
scared
and
cried
and
said
he
wanted
to
go
home
to
his
ma
and
want
to
be
a
robber
any
more
so
they
all
made
fun
of
him
and
called
him
and
that
made
him
mad
and
he
said
he
would
go
straight
and
tell
all
the
secrets
but
tom
give
him
five
cents
to
keep
quiet
and
said
we
would
all
go
home
and
meet
next
week
and
rob
somebody
and
kill
some
people
ben
rogers
said
he
get
out
much
only
sundays
and
so
he
wanted
to
begin
next
sunday
but
all
the
boys
said
it
would
be
wicked
to
do
it
on
sunday
and
that
settled
the
thing
they
agreed
to
get
together
and
fix
a
day
as
soon
as
they
could
and
then
we
elected
tom
sawyer
first
captain
and
jo
harper
second
captain
of
the
gang
and
so
started
home
i
clumb
up
the
shed
and
crept
into
my
window
just
before
day
was
breaking
my
new
clothes
was
all
greased
up
and
clayey
and
i
was
chapter
iii
well
i
got
a
good
in
the
morning
from
old
miss
watson
on
account
of
my
clothes
but
the
widow
she
scold
but
only
cleaned
off
the
grease
and
clay
and
looked
so
sorry
that
i
thought
i
would
behave
awhile
if
i
could
then
miss
watson
she
took
me
in
the
closet
and
prayed
but
nothing
come
of
it
she
told
me
to
pray
every
day
and
whatever
i
asked
for
i
would
get
it
but
it
so
i
tried
it
once
i
got
a
but
no
hooks
it
any
good
to
me
without
hooks
i
tried
for
the
hooks
three
or
four
times
but
somehow
i
make
it
work
by
and
by
one
day
i
asked
miss
watson
to
try
for
me
but
she
said
i
was
a
fool
she
never
told
me
why
and
i
make
it
out
no
way
i
set
down
one
time
back
in
the
woods
and
had
a
long
think
about
it
i
says
to
myself
if
a
body
can
get
anything
they
pray
for
why
deacon
winn
get
back
the
money
he
lost
on
pork
why
the
widow
get
back
her
silver
snuffbox
that
was
stole
why
miss
watson
fat
up
no
says
i
to
my
self
there
nothing
in
it
i
went
and
told
the
widow
about
it
and
she
said
the
thing
a
body
could
get
by
praying
for
it
was
spiritual
gifts
this
was
too
many
for
me
but
she
told
me
what
she
meant
i
must
help
other
people
and
do
everything
i
could
for
other
people
and
look
out
for
them
all
the
time
and
never
think
about
myself
this
was
including
miss
watson
as
i
took
it
i
went
out
in
the
woods
and
turned
it
over
in
my
mind
a
long
time
but
i
see
no
advantage
about
it
except
for
the
other
people
so
at
last
i
reckoned
i
worry
about
it
any
more
but
just
let
it
go
sometimes
the
widow
would
take
me
one
side
and
talk
about
providence
in
a
way
to
make
a
mouth
water
but
maybe
next
day
miss
watson
would
take
hold
and
knock
it
all
down
again
i
judged
i
could
see
that
there
was
two
providences
and
a
poor
chap
would
stand
considerable
show
with
the
providence
but
if
miss
got
him
there
no
help
for
him
any
more
i
thought
it
all
out
and
reckoned
i
would
belong
to
the
if
he
wanted
me
though
i
make
out
how
he
was
to
be
any
better
off
then
than
what
he
was
before
seeing
i
was
so
ignorant
and
so
kind
of
and
ornery
pap
he
been
seen
for
more
than
a
year
and
that
was
comfortable
for
me
i
want
to
see
him
no
more
he
used
to
always
whale
me
when
he
was
sober
and
could
get
his
hands
on
me
though
i
used
to
take
to
the
woods
most
of
the
time
when
he
was
around
well
about
this
time
he
was
found
in
the
river
drownded
about
twelve
mile
above
town
so
people
said
they
judged
it
was
him
anyway
said
this
drownded
man
was
just
his
size
and
was
ragged
and
had
uncommon
long
hair
which
was
all
like
pap
but
they
make
nothing
out
of
the
face
because
it
had
been
in
the
water
so
long
it
much
like
a
face
at
all
they
said
he
was
floating
on
his
back
in
the
water
they
took
him
and
buried
him
on
the
bank
but
i
comfortable
long
because
i
happened
to
think
of
something
i
knowed
mighty
well
that
a
drownded
man
float
on
his
back
but
on
his
face
so
i
knowed
then
that
this
pap
but
a
woman
dressed
up
in
a
clothes
so
i
was
uncomfortable
again
i
judged
the
old
man
would
turn
up
again
by
and
by
though
i
wished
he
we
played
robber
now
and
then
about
a
month
and
then
i
resigned
all
the
boys
did
we
robbed
nobody
killed
any
people
but
only
just
pretended
we
used
to
hop
out
of
the
woods
and
go
charging
down
on
and
women
in
carts
taking
garden
stuff
to
market
but
we
never
hived
any
of
them
tom
sawyer
called
the
hogs
ingots
and
he
called
the
turnips
and
stuff
julery
and
we
would
go
to
the
cave
and
powwow
over
what
we
had
done
and
how
many
people
we
had
killed
and
marked
but
i
see
no
profit
in
it
one
time
tom
sent
a
boy
to
run
about
town
with
a
blazing
stick
which
he
called
a
slogan
which
was
the
sign
for
the
gang
to
get
together
and
then
he
said
he
had
got
secret
news
by
his
spies
that
next
day
a
whole
parcel
of
spanish
merchants
and
rich
was
going
to
camp
in
cave
hollow
with
two
hundred
elephants
and
six
hundred
camels
and
over
a
thousand
sumter
mules
all
loaded
down
with
and
they
have
only
a
guard
of
four
hundred
soldiers
and
so
we
would
lay
in
ambuscade
as
he
called
it
and
kill
the
lot
and
scoop
the
things
he
said
we
must
slick
up
our
swords
and
guns
and
get
ready
he
never
could
go
after
even
a
but
he
must
have
the
swords
and
guns
all
scoured
up
for
it
though
they
was
only
lath
and
broomsticks
and
you
might
scour
at
them
till
you
rotted
and
then
they
worth
a
mouthful
of
ashes
more
than
what
they
was
before
i
believe
we
could
lick
such
a
crowd
of
spaniards
and
but
i
wanted
to
see
the
camels
and
elephants
so
i
was
on
hand
next
day
saturday
in
the
ambuscade
and
when
we
got
the
word
we
rushed
out
of
the
woods
and
down
the
hill
but
there
no
spaniards
and
and
there
no
camels
nor
no
elephants
it
anything
but
a
picnic
and
only
a
at
that
we
busted
it
up
and
chased
the
children
up
the
hollow
but
we
never
got
anything
but
some
doughnuts
and
jam
though
ben
rogers
got
a
rag
doll
and
jo
harper
got
a
and
a
tract
and
then
the
teacher
charged
in
and
made
us
drop
everything
and
cut
i
see
no
and
i
told
tom
sawyer
so
he
said
there
was
loads
of
them
there
anyway
and
he
said
there
was
there
too
and
elephants
and
things
i
said
why
we
see
them
then
he
said
if
i
so
ignorant
but
had
read
a
book
called
don
quixote
i
would
know
without
asking
he
said
it
was
all
done
by
enchantment
he
said
there
was
hundreds
of
soldiers
there
and
elephants
and
treasure
and
so
on
but
we
had
enemies
which
he
called
magicians
and
they
had
turned
the
whole
thing
into
an
infant
just
out
of
spite
i
said
all
right
then
the
thing
for
us
to
do
was
to
go
for
the
magicians
tom
sawyer
said
i
was
a
numskull
why
said
he
a
magician
could
call
up
a
lot
of
genies
and
they
would
hash
you
up
like
nothing
before
you
could
say
jack
robinson
they
are
as
tall
as
a
tree
and
as
big
around
as
a
church
well
i
says
we
got
some
genies
to
help
us
we
lick
the
other
crowd
then
how
you
going
to
get
them
i
know
how
do
they
get
them
why
they
rub
an
old
tin
lamp
or
an
iron
ring
and
then
the
genies
come
tearing
in
with
the
thunder
and
lightning
around
and
the
smoke
and
everything
told
to
do
they
up
and
do
it
they
think
nothing
of
pulling
a
up
by
the
roots
and
belting
a
superintendent
over
the
head
with
it
or
any
other
man
who
makes
them
tear
around
so
why
whoever
rubs
the
lamp
or
the
ring
they
belong
to
whoever
rubs
the
lamp
or
the
ring
and
got
to
do
whatever
he
says
if
he
tells
them
to
build
a
palace
forty
miles
long
out
of
and
fill
it
full
of
or
whatever
you
want
and
fetch
an
daughter
from
china
for
you
to
marry
got
to
do
it
and
got
to
do
it
before
next
morning
too
and
more
got
to
waltz
that
palace
around
over
the
country
wherever
you
want
it
you
understand
well
says
i
i
think
they
are
a
pack
of
for
not
keeping
the
palace
themselves
of
fooling
them
away
like
that
and
more
if
i
was
one
of
them
i
would
see
a
man
in
jericho
before
i
would
drop
my
business
and
come
to
him
for
the
rubbing
of
an
old
tin
lamp
how
you
talk
huck
finn
why
have
to
come
when
he
rubbed
it
whether
you
wanted
to
or
not
what
and
i
as
high
as
a
tree
and
as
big
as
a
church
all
right
then
i
would
come
but
i
lay
make
that
man
climb
the
highest
tree
there
was
in
the
country
shucks
it
no
use
to
talk
to
you
huck
finn
you
seem
to
know
anything
somehow
perfect
saphead
i
thought
all
this
over
for
two
or
three
days
and
then
i
reckoned
i
would
see
if
there
was
anything
in
it
i
got
an
old
tin
lamp
and
an
iron
ring
and
went
out
in
the
woods
and
rubbed
and
rubbed
till
i
sweat
like
an
injun
calculating
to
build
a
palace
and
sell
it
but
it
no
use
none
of
the
genies
come
so
then
i
judged
that
all
that
stuff
was
only
just
one
of
tom
lies
i
reckoned
he
believed
in
the
and
the
elephants
but
as
for
me
i
think
different
it
had
all
the
marks
of
a
chapter
iv
well
three
or
four
months
run
along
and
it
was
well
into
the
winter
now
i
had
been
to
school
most
all
the
time
and
could
spell
and
read
and
write
just
a
little
and
could
say
the
multiplication
table
up
to
six
times
seven
is
and
i
reckon
i
could
ever
get
any
further
than
that
if
i
was
to
live
forever
i
take
no
stock
in
mathematics
anyway
at
first
i
hated
the
school
but
by
and
by
i
got
so
i
could
stand
it
whenever
i
got
uncommon
tired
i
played
hookey
and
the
hiding
i
got
next
day
done
me
good
and
cheered
me
up
so
the
longer
i
went
to
school
the
easier
it
got
to
be
i
was
getting
sort
of
used
to
the
ways
too
and
they
so
raspy
on
me
living
in
a
house
and
sleeping
in
a
bed
pulled
on
me
pretty
tight
mostly
but
before
the
cold
weather
i
used
to
slide
out
and
sleep
in
the
woods
sometimes
and
so
that
was
a
rest
to
me
i
liked
the
old
ways
best
but
i
was
getting
so
i
liked
the
new
ones
too
a
little
bit
the
widow
said
i
was
coming
along
slow
but
sure
and
doing
very
satisfactory
she
said
she
ashamed
of
me
one
morning
i
happened
to
turn
over
the
at
breakfast
i
reached
for
some
of
it
as
quick
as
i
could
to
throw
over
my
left
shoulder
and
keep
off
the
bad
luck
but
miss
watson
was
in
ahead
of
me
and
crossed
me
off
she
says
take
your
hands
away
huckleberry
what
a
mess
you
are
always
making
the
widow
put
in
a
good
word
for
me
but
that
going
to
keep
off
the
bad
luck
i
knowed
that
well
enough
i
started
out
after
breakfast
feeling
worried
and
shaky
and
wondering
where
it
was
going
to
fall
on
me
and
what
it
was
going
to
be
there
is
ways
to
keep
off
some
kinds
of
bad
luck
but
this
one
of
them
kind
so
i
never
tried
to
do
anything
but
just
poked
along
and
on
the
i
went
down
to
the
front
garden
and
clumb
over
the
stile
where
you
go
through
the
high
board
fence
there
was
an
inch
of
new
snow
on
the
ground
and
i
seen
tracks
they
had
come
up
from
the
quarry
and
stood
around
the
stile
a
while
and
then
went
on
around
the
garden
fence
it
was
funny
they
come
in
after
standing
around
so
i
make
it
out
it
was
very
curious
somehow
i
was
going
to
follow
around
but
i
stooped
down
to
look
at
the
tracks
first
i
notice
anything
at
first
but
next
i
did
there
was
a
cross
in
the
left
made
with
big
nails
to
keep
off
the
devil
i
was
up
in
a
second
and
shinning
down
the
hill
i
looked
over
my
shoulder
every
now
and
then
but
i
see
nobody
i
was
at
judge
as
quick
as
i
could
get
there
he
said
why
my
boy
you
are
all
out
of
breath
did
you
come
for
your
interest
no
sir
i
says
is
there
some
for
me
oh
yes
a
is
in
last
night
over
a
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
quite
a
fortune
for
you
you
had
better
let
me
invest
it
along
with
your
six
thousand
because
if
you
take
it
spend
it
no
sir
i
says
i
want
to
spend
it
i
want
it
at
all
nor
the
six
thousand
nuther
i
want
you
to
take
it
i
want
to
give
it
to
you
the
six
thousand
and
all
he
looked
surprised
he
seem
to
make
it
out
he
says
why
what
can
you
mean
my
boy
i
says
you
ask
me
no
questions
about
it
please
take
it
you
he
says
well
puzzled
is
something
the
matter
please
take
it
says
i
and
ask
me
nothing
then
i
have
to
tell
no
lies
he
studied
a
while
and
then
he
says
i
think
i
see
you
want
to
sell
all
your
property
to
me
not
give
it
the
correct
idea
then
he
wrote
something
on
a
paper
and
read
it
over
and
says
there
you
see
it
says
a
consideration
that
means
i
have
bought
it
of
you
and
paid
you
for
it
a
dollar
for
you
now
you
sign
it
so
i
signed
it
and
left
miss
nigger
jim
had
a
as
big
as
your
fist
which
had
been
took
out
of
the
fourth
stomach
of
an
ox
and
he
used
to
do
magic
with
it
he
said
there
was
a
spirit
inside
of
it
and
it
knowed
everything
so
i
went
to
him
that
night
and
told
him
pap
was
here
again
for
i
found
his
tracks
in
the
snow
what
i
wanted
to
know
was
what
he
was
going
to
do
and
was
he
going
to
stay
jim
got
out
his
and
said
something
over
it
and
then
he
held
it
up
and
dropped
it
on
the
floor
it
fell
pretty
solid
and
only
rolled
about
an
inch
jim
tried
it
again
and
then
another
time
and
it
acted
just
the
same
jim
got
down
on
his
knees
and
put
his
ear
against
it
and
listened
but
it
no
use
he
said
it
talk
he
said
sometimes
it
talk
without
money
i
told
him
i
had
an
old
slick
counterfeit
quarter
that
no
good
because
the
brass
showed
through
the
silver
a
little
and
it
pass
nohow
even
if
the
brass
show
because
it
was
so
slick
it
felt
greasy
and
so
that
would
tell
on
it
every
time
i
reckoned
i
say
nothing
about
the
dollar
i
got
from
the
judge
i
said
it
was
pretty
bad
money
but
maybe
the
would
take
it
because
maybe
it
know
the
difference
jim
smelt
it
and
bit
it
and
rubbed
it
and
said
he
would
manage
so
the
would
think
it
was
good
he
said
he
would
split
open
a
raw
irish
potato
and
stick
the
quarter
in
between
and
keep
it
there
all
night
and
next
morning
you
see
no
brass
and
it
feel
greasy
no
more
and
so
anybody
in
town
would
take
it
in
a
minute
let
alone
a
well
i
knowed
a
potato
would
do
that
before
but
i
had
forgot
it
jim
put
the
quarter
under
the
and
got
down
and
listened
again
this
time
he
said
the
was
all
right
he
said
it
would
tell
my
whole
fortune
if
i
wanted
it
to
i
says
go
on
so
the
talked
to
jim
and
jim
told
it
to
me

to
him
about
temperance
and
such
things
till
the
old
man
cried
and
said

a
fool
and
fooled
away

life
but
now
he
was
to
turn
over
a
new
leaf
and
be
a
man
nobody
be
ashamed
of
and
he
hoped
the
judge
would
help
him
and
not
look
down
on
him
the
judge
said
he
could
hug
him
for
them
words

he
cried
and
his
wife
she
cried
again
pap
said

a
man
that

always
been
misunderstood
before
and
the
judge
said
he
believed
it
the
old
man
said
that
what
a
man
wanted
that
was
down
was
sympathy
and
the
judge
said
it
was
so
so
they
cried
again
and
when
it
was
bedtime
the
old
man
rose
up
and
held
out
his
hand
and
says
look
at
it
gentlemen
and
ladies

of
it

it
a
hand

was
the
hand
of
a
hog

hand
of
a
man
started
in
on
a
new
life

mark
them

said
them
a
clean
hand
now

they
shook
it
one
after
the
other
all
around
and
cried
the
wife
she
kissed
it
then
the
old
man
he
signed
a
pledge
made
his
mark
the
judge
said
it
was
the
holiest
time
on
record
or
something
like
that
then
they
tucked
the
old
man
into
a
beautiful
room
which
was
the
spare
room
and
in
the
night
some
time
he
got
powerful
thirsty
and
clumb
out
on
to
the
and
slid
down
a
stanchion
and
traded
his
new
coat
for
a
jug
of
and
clumb
back
again
and
had
a
good
old
time
and
towards
daylight
he
crawled
out
again
drunk
as
a
fiddler
and
rolled
off
the
porch
and
broke
his
left
arm
in
two
places
and
was
most
froze
to
death
when
somebody
found
him
after
and
when
they
come
to
look
at
that
spare
room
they
had
to
take
soundings
before
they
could
navigate
it
the
judge
he
felt
kind
of
sore
he
said
he
reckoned
a
body
could
reform
the
old
man
with
a
shotgun
maybe
but
he
know
no
other
way
chapter
vi
well
pretty
soon
the
old
man
was
up
and
around
again
and
then
he
went
for
judge
thatcher
in
the
courts
to
make
him
give
up
that
money
and
he
went
for
me
too
for
not
stopping
school
he
catched
me
a
couple
of
times
and
thrashed
me
but
i
went
to
school
just
the
same
and
dodged
him
or
outrun
him
most
of
the
time
i
want
to
go
to
school
much
before
but
i
reckoned
go
now
to
spite
pap
that
law
trial
was
a
slow
business
appeared
like
they
ever
going
to
get
started
on
it
so
every
now
and
then
borrow
two
or
three
dollars
off
of
the
judge
for
him
to
keep
from
getting
a
cowhiding
every
time
he
got
money
he
got
drunk
and
every
time
he
got
drunk
he
raised
cain
around
town
and
every
time
he
raised
cain
he
got
jailed
he
was
just
suited
this
kind
of
thing
was
right
in
his
line
he
got
to
hanging
around
the
too
much
and
so
she
told
him
at
last
that
if
he
quit
using
around
there
she
would
make
trouble
for
him
well
he
mad
he
said
he
would
show
who
was
huck
boss
so
he
watched
out
for
me
one
day
in
the
spring
and
catched
me
and
took
me
up
the
river
about
three
mile
in
a
skiff
and
crossed
over
to
the
illinois
shore
where
it
was
woody
and
there
no
houses
but
an
old
log
hut
in
a
place
where
the
timber
was
so
thick
you
find
it
if
you
know
where
it
was
he
kept
me
with
him
all
the
time
and
i
never
got
a
chance
to
run
off
we
lived
in
that
old
cabin
and
he
always
locked
the
door
and
put
the
key
under
his
head
nights
he
had
a
gun
which
he
had
stole
i
reckon
and
we
fished
and
hunted
and
that
was
what
we
lived
on
every
little
while
he
locked
me
in
and
went
down
to
the
store
three
miles
to
the
ferry
and
traded
fish
and
game
for
whisky
and
fetched
it
home
and
got
drunk
and
had
a
good
time
and
licked
me
the
widow
she
found
out
where
i
was
by
and
by
and
she
sent
a
man
over
to
try
to
get
hold
of
me
but
pap
drove
him
off
with
the
gun
and
it
long
after
that
till
i
was
used
to
being
where
i
was
and
liked
it
all
but
the
cowhide
part
it
was
kind
of
lazy
and
jolly
laying
off
comfortable
all
day
smoking
and
fishing
and
no
books
nor
study
two
months
or
more
run
along
and
my
clothes
got
to
be
all
rags
and
dirt
and
i
see
how
ever
got
to
like
it
so
well
at
the
where
you
had
to
wash
and
eat
on
a
plate
and
comb
up
and
go
to
bed
and
get
up
regular
and
be
forever
bothering
over
a
book
and
have
old
miss
watson
pecking
at
you
all
the
time
i
want
to
go
back
no
more
i
had
stopped
cussing
because
the
widow
like
it
but
now
i
took
to
it
again
because
pap
no
objections
it
was
pretty
good
times
up
in
the
woods
there
take
it
all
around
but
by
and
by
pap
got
too
handy
with
his
and
i
stand
it
i
was
all
over
welts
he
got
to
going
away
so
much
too
and
locking
me
in
once
he
locked
me
in
and
was
gone
three
days
it
was
dreadful
lonesome
i
judged
he
had
got
drowned
and
i
ever
going
to
get
out
any
more
i
was
scared
i
made
up
my
mind
i
would
fix
up
some
way
to
leave
there
i
had
tried
to
get
out
of
that
cabin
many
a
time
but
i
find
no
way
there
a
window
to
it
big
enough
for
a
dog
to
get
through
i
get
up
the
chimbly
it
was
too
narrow
the
door
was
thick
solid
oak
slabs
pap
was
pretty
careful
not
to
leave
a
knife
or
anything
in
the
cabin
when
he
was
away
i
reckon
i
had
hunted
the
place
over
as
much
as
a
hundred
times
well
i
was
most
all
the
time
at
it
because
it
was
about
the
only
way
to
put
in
the
time
but
this
time
i
found
something
at
last
i
found
an
old
rusty
without
any
handle
it
was
laid
in
between
a
rafter
and
the
clapboards
of
the
roof
i
greased
it
up
and
went
to
work
there
was
an
old
nailed
against
the
logs
at
the
far
end
of
the
cabin
behind
the
table
to
keep
the
wind
from
blowing
through
the
chinks
and
putting
the
candle
out
i
got
under
the
table
and
raised
the
blanket
and
went
to
work
to
saw
a
section
of
the
big
bottom
log
out
big
enough
to
let
me
through
well
it
was
a
good
long
job
but
i
was
getting
towards
the
end
of
it
when
i
heard
gun
in
the
woods
i
got
rid
of
the
signs
of
my
work
and
dropped
the
blanket
and
hid
my
saw
and
pretty
soon
pap
come
in
pap
in
a
good
humor
so
he
was
his
natural
self
he
said
he
was
down
town
and
everything
was
going
wrong
his
lawyer
said
he
reckoned
he
would
win
his
lawsuit
and
get
the
money
if
they
ever
got
started
on
the
trial
but
then
there
was
ways
to
put
it
off
a
long
time
and
judge
thatcher
knowed
how
to
do
it
and
he
said
people
allowed
be
another
trial
to
get
me
away
from
him
and
give
me
to
the
widow
for
my
guardian
and
they
guessed
it
would
win
this
time
this
shook
me
up
considerable
because
i
want
to
go
back
to
the
any
more
and
be
so
cramped
up
and
sivilized
as
they
called
it
then
the
old
man
got
to
cussing
and
cussed
everything
and
everybody
he
could
think
of
and
then
cussed
them
all
over
again
to
make
sure
he
skipped
any
and
after
that
he
polished
off
with
a
kind
of
a
general
cuss
all
round
including
a
considerable
parcel
of
people
which
he
know
the
names
of
and
so
called
them
when
he
got
to
them
and
went
right
along
with
his
cussing
he
said
he
would
like
to
see
the
widow
get
me
he
said
he
would
watch
out
and
if
they
tried
to
come
any
such
game
on
him
he
knowed
of
a
place
six
or
seven
mile
off
to
stow
me
in
where
they
might
hunt
till
they
dropped
and
they
find
me
that
made
me
pretty
uneasy
again
but
only
for
a
minute
i
reckoned
i
stay
on
hand
till
he
got
that
chance
the
old
man
made
me
go
to
the
skiff
and
fetch
the
things
he
had
got
there
was
a
sack
of
corn
meal
and
a
side
of
bacon
ammunition
and
a
jug
of
whisky
and
an
old
book
and
two
newspapers
for
wadding
besides
some
tow
i
toted
up
a
load
and
went
back
and
set
down
on
the
bow
of
the
skiff
to
rest
i
thought
it
all
over
and
i
reckoned
i
would
walk
off
with
the
gun
and
some
lines
and
take
to
the
woods
when
i
run
away
i
guessed
i
stay
in
one
place
but
just
tramp
right
across
the
country
mostly
night
times
and
hunt
and
fish
to
keep
alive
and
so
get
so
far
away
that
the
old
man
nor
the
widow
ever
find
me
any
more
i
judged
i
would
saw
out
and
leave
that
night
if
pap
got
drunk
enough
and
i
reckoned
he
would
i
got
so
full
of
it
i
notice
how
long
i
was
staying
till
the
old
man
hollered
and
asked
me
whether
i
was
asleep
or
drownded
i
got
the
things
all
up
to
the
cabin
and
then
it
was
about
dark
while
i
was
cooking
supper
the
old
man
took
a
swig
or
two
and
got
sort
of
warmed
up
and
went
to
ripping
again
he
had
been
drunk
over
in
town
and
laid
in
the
gutter
all
night
and
he
was
a
sight
to
look
at
a
body
would
a
thought
he
was
adam
he
was
just
all
mud
whenever
his
liquor
begun
to
work
he
most
always
went
for
the
govment
this
time
he
says
call
this
a
govment
why
just
look
at
it
and
see
what
like
the
law
ready
to
take
a
son
away
from
him
a
own
son
which
he
has
had
all
the
trouble
and
all
the
anxiety
and
all
the
expense
of
raising
yes
just
as
that
man
has
got
that
son
raised
at
last
and
ready
to
go
to
work
and
begin
to
do
for
him
and
give
him
a
rest
the
law
up
and
goes
for
him
and
they
call
that
govment
that
all
nuther
the
law
backs
that
old
judge
thatcher
up
and
helps
him
to
keep
me
out
my
property
what
the
law
does
the
law
takes
a
man
worth
six
thousand
dollars
and
and
jams
him
into
an
old
trap
of
a
cabin
like
this
and
lets
him
go
round
in
clothes
that
fitten
for
a
hog
they
call
that
govment
a
man
get
his
rights
in
a
govment
like
this
sometimes
a
mighty
notion
to
just
leave
the
country
for
good
and
all
yes
and
i
told
so
i
told
old
thatcher
so
to
his
face
lots
of
heard
me
and
can
tell
what
i
said
says
i
for
two
cents
leave
the
blamed
country
and
never
come
it
agin
the
very
words
i
says
look
at
my
hat
if
you
call
it
a
hat
but
the
lid
raises
up
and
the
rest
of
it
goes
down
till
below
my
chin
and
then
it
rightly
a
hat
at
all
but
more
like
my
head
was
shoved
up
through
a
jint
look
at
it
says
i
such
a
hat
for
me
to
wear
one
of
the
wealthiest
men
in
this
town
if
i
could
git
my
rights
oh
yes
this
is
a
wonderful
govment
wonderful
why
looky
here
there
was
a
free
nigger
there
from
ohio
a
mulatter
most
as
white
as
a
white
man
he
had
the
whitest
shirt
on
you
ever
see
too
and
the
shiniest
hat
and
there
a
man
in
that
town
got
as
fine
clothes
as
what
he
had
and
he
had
a
gold
watch
and
chain
and
a
cane
the
awfulest
old
nabob
in
the
state
and
what
do
you
think
they
said
he
was
a
in
a
college
and
could
talk
all
kinds
of
languages
and
knowed
everything
and
that
the
wust
they
said
he
could
vote
when
he
was
at
home
well
that
let
me
out
thinks
i
what
is
the
country
to
it
was
day
and
i
was
just
about
to
go
and
vote
myself
if
i
too
drunk
to
get
there
but
when
they
told
me
there
was
a
state
in
this
country
where
let
that
nigger
vote
i
drawed
out
i
says
never
vote
agin
the
very
words
i
said
they
all
heard
me
and
the
country
may
rot
for
all
me
never
vote
agin
as
long
as
i
live
and
to
see
the
cool
way
of
that
nigger
why
he
a
give
me
the
road
if
i
shoved
him
out
the
way
i
says
to
the
people
why
this
nigger
put
up
at
auction
and
sold
what
i
want
to
know
and
what
do
you
reckon
they
said
why
they
said
he
be
sold
till
been
in
the
state
six
months
and
he
been
there
that
long
yet
there
now
a
specimen
they
call
that
a
govment
that
sell
a
free
nigger
till
been
in
the
state
six
months
a
govment
that
calls
itself
a
govment
and
lets
on
to
be
a
govment
and
thinks
it
is
a
govment
and
got
to
set
for
six
whole
months
before
it
can
take
a
hold
of
a
prowling
thieving
infernal
free
nigger
and
pap
was
agoing
on
so
he
never
noticed
where
his
old
limber
legs
was
taking
him
to
so
he
went
head
over
heels
over
the
tub
of
salt
pork
and
barked
both
shins
and
the
rest
of
his
speech
was
all
the
hottest
kind
of
language
mostly
hove
at
the
nigger
and
the
govment
though
he
give
the
tub
some
too
all
along
here
and
there
he
hopped
around
the
cabin
considerable
first
on
one
leg
and
then
on
the
other
holding
first
one
shin
and
then
the
other
one
and
at
last
he
let
out
with
his
left
foot
all
of
a
sudden
and
fetched
the
tub
a
rattling
kick
but
it
good
judgment
because
that
was
the
boot
that
had
a
couple
of
his
toes
leaking
out
of
the
front
end
of
it
so
now
he
raised
a
howl
that
fairly
made
a
hair
raise
and
down
he
went
in
the
dirt
and
rolled
there
and
held
his
toes
and
the
cussing
he
done
then
laid
over
anything
he
had
ever
done
previous
he
said
so
his
own
self
afterwards
he
had
heard
old
sowberry
hagan
in
his
best
days
and
he
said
it
laid
over
him
too
but
i
reckon
that
was
sort
of
piling
it
on
maybe
after
supper
pap
took
the
jug
and
said
he
had
enough
whisky
there
for
two
drunks
and
one
delirium
tremens
that
was
always
his
word
i
judged
he
would
be
blind
drunk
in
about
an
hour
and
then
i
would
steal
the
key
or
saw
myself
out
one
or
he
drank
and
drank
and
tumbled
down
on
his
blankets
by
and
by
but
luck
run
my
way
he
go
sound
asleep
but
was
uneasy
he
groaned
and
moaned
and
thrashed
around
this
way
and
that
for
a
long
time
at
last
i
got
so
sleepy
i
keep
my
eyes
open
all
i
could
do
and
so
before
i
knowed
what
i
was
about
i
was
sound
asleep
and
the
candle
burning
i
know
how
long
i
was
asleep
but
all
of
a
sudden
there
was
an
awful
scream
and
i
was
up
there
was
pap
looking
wild
and
skipping
around
every
which
way
and
yelling
about
snakes
he
said
they
was
crawling
up
his
legs
and
then
he
would
give
a
jump
and
scream
and
say
one
had
bit
him
on
the
cheek
but
i
see
no
snakes
he
started
and
run
round
and
round
the
cabin
hollering
take
him
off
take
him
off
biting
me
on
the
neck
i
never
see
a
man
look
so
wild
in
the
eyes
pretty
soon
he
was
all
fagged
out
and
fell
down
panting
then
he
rolled
over
and
over
wonderful
fast
kicking
things
every
which
way
and
striking
and
grabbing
at
the
air
with
his
hands
and
screaming
and
saying
there
was
devils
of
him
he
wore
out
by
and
by
and
laid
still
a
while
moaning
then
he
laid
stiller
and
make
a
sound
i
could
hear
the
owls
and
the
wolves
away
off
in
the
woods
and
it
seemed
terrible
still
he
was
laying
over
by
the
corner
by
and
by
he
raised
up
part
way
and
listened
with
his
head
to
one
side
he
says
very
low
tramp
tramp
tramp
the
dead
tramp
tramp
tramp
coming
after
me
but
i
go
oh
here
touch
me
hands
off
cold
let
go
oh
let
a
poor
devil
alone
then
he
went
down
on
all
fours
and
crawled
off
begging
them
to
let
him
alone
and
he
rolled
himself
up
in
his
blanket
and
wallowed
in
under
the
old
pine
table
still
and
then
he
went
to
crying
i
could
hear
him
through
the
blanket
by
and
by
he
rolled
out
and
jumped
up
on
his
feet
looking
wild
and
he
see
me
and
went
for
me
he
chased
me
round
and
round
the
place
with
a
calling
me
the
angel
of
death
and
saying
he
would
kill
me
and
then
i
come
for
him
no
more
i
begged
and
told
him
i
was
only
huck
but
he
laughed
such
a
screechy
laugh
and
roared
and
cussed
and
kept
on
chasing
me
up
once
when
i
turned
short
and
dodged
under
his
arm
he
made
a
grab
and
got
me
by
the
jacket
between
my
shoulders
and
i
thought
i
was
gone
but
i
slid
out
of
the
jacket
quick
as
lightning
and
saved
myself
pretty
soon
he
was
all
tired
out
and
dropped
down
with
his
back
against
the
door
and
said
he
would
rest
a
minute
and
then
kill
me
he
put
his
knife
under
him
and
said
he
would
sleep
and
get
strong
and
then
he
would
see
who
was
who
so
he
dozed
off
pretty
soon
by
and
by
i
got
the
old
chair
and
clumb
up
as
easy
as
i
could
not
to
make
any
noise
and
got
down
the
gun
i
slipped
the
ramrod
down
it
to
make
sure
it
was
loaded
then
i
laid
it
across
the
turnip
barrel
pointing
towards
pap
and
set
down
behind
it
to
wait
for
him
to
stir
and
how
slow
and
still
the
time
did
drag
along
chapter
vii
git
up
what
you
i
opened
my
eyes
and
looked
around
trying
to
make
out
where
i
was
it
was
after
and
i
had
been
sound
asleep
pap
was
standing
over
me
looking
sour
and
sick
too
he
says
what
you
with
this
gun
i
judged
he
know
nothing
about
what
he
had
been
doing
so
i
says
somebody
tried
to
get
in
so
i
was
laying
for
him
why
you
roust
me
out
well
i
tried
to
but
i
i
budge
you
well
all
right
stand
there
palavering
all
day
but
out
with
you
and
see
if
a
fish
on
the
lines
for
breakfast
be
along
in
a
minute
he
unlocked
the
door
and
i
cleared
out
up
the
i
noticed
some
pieces
of
limbs
and
such
things
floating
down
and
a
sprinkling
of
bark
so
i
knowed
the
river
had
begun
to
rise
i
reckoned
i
would
have
great
times
now
if
i
was
over
at
the
town
the
june
rise
used
to
be
always
luck
for
me
because
as
soon
as
that
rise
begins
here
comes
cordwood
floating
down
and
pieces
of
log
rafts
sometimes
a
dozen
logs
together
so
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
catch
them
and
sell
them
to
the
and
the
sawmill
i
went
along
up
the
bank
with
one
eye
out
for
pap
and
one
out
for
what
the
rise
might
fetch
along
well
all
at
once
here
comes
a
canoe
just
a
beauty
too
about
thirteen
or
fourteen
foot
long
riding
high
like
a
duck
i
shot
off
of
the
bank
like
a
frog
clothes
and
all
on
and
struck
out
for
the
canoe
i
just
expected
be
somebody
laying
down
in
it
because
people
often
done
that
to
fool
folks
and
when
a
chap
had
pulled
a
skiff
out
most
to
it
raise
up
and
laugh
at
him
but
it
so
this
time
it
was
a
sure
enough
and
i
clumb
in
and
paddled
her
ashore
thinks
i
the
old
man
will
be
glad
when
he
sees
this
worth
ten
dollars
but
when
i
got
to
shore
pap
in
sight
yet
and
as
i
was
running
her
into
a
little
creek
like
a
gully
all
hung
over
with
vines
and
willows
i
struck
another
idea
i
judged
hide
her
good
and
then
of
taking
to
the
woods
when
i
run
off
go
down
the
river
about
fifty
mile
and
camp
in
one
place
for
good
and
not
have
such
a
rough
time
tramping
on
foot
it
was
pretty
close
to
the
shanty
and
i
thought
i
heard
the
old
man
coming
all
the
time
but
i
got
her
hid
and
then
i
out
and
looked
around
a
bunch
of
willows
and
there
was
the
old
man
down
the
path
a
piece
just
drawing
a
bead
on
a
bird
with
his
gun
so
he
seen
anything
when
he
got
along
i
was
hard
at
it
taking
up
a
trot
line
he
abused
me
a
little
for
being
so
slow
but
i
told
him
i
fell
in
the
river
and
that
was
what
made
me
so
long
i
knowed
he
would
see
i
was
wet
and
then
he
would
be
asking
questions
we
got
five
catfish
off
the
lines
and
went
home
while
we
laid
off
after
breakfast
to
sleep
up
both
of
us
being
about
wore
out
i
got
to
thinking
that
if
i
could
fix
up
some
way
to
keep
pap
and
the
widow
from
trying
to
follow
me
it
would
be
a
certainer
thing
than
trusting
to
luck
to
get
far
enough
off
before
they
missed
me
you
see
all
kinds
of
things
might
happen
well
i
see
no
way
for
a
while
but
by
and
by
pap
raised
up
a
minute
to
drink
another
barrel
of
water
and
he
says
another
time
a
man
comes
round
here
you
roust
me
out
you
hear
that
man
here
for
no
good
a
shot
him
next
time
you
roust
me
out
you
hear
then
he
dropped
down
and
went
to
sleep
again
but
what
he
had
been
saying
give
me
the
very
idea
i
wanted
i
says
to
myself
i
can
fix
it
now
so
nobody
think
of
following
me
about
twelve
we
turned
out
and
went
along
up
the
bank
the
river
was
coming
up
pretty
fast
and
lots
of
driftwood
going
by
on
the
rise
by
and
by
along
comes
part
of
a
log
raft
nine
logs
fast
together
we
went
out
with
the
skiff
and
towed
it
ashore
then
we
had
dinner
anybody
but
pap
would
a
waited
and
seen
the
day
through
so
as
to
catch
more
stuff
but
that
style
nine
logs
was
enough
for
one
time
he
must
shove
right
over
to
town
and
sell
so
he
locked
me
in
and
took
the
skiff
and
started
off
towing
the
raft
about
three
i
judged
he
come
back
that
night
i
waited
till
i
reckoned
he
had
got
a
good
start
then
i
out
with
my
saw
and
went
to
work
on
that
log
again
before
he
was
side
of
the
river
i
was
out
of
the
hole
him
and
his
raft
was
just
a
speck
on
the
water
away
off
yonder
i
took
the
sack
of
corn
meal
and
took
it
to
where
the
canoe
was
hid
and
shoved
the
vines
and
branches
apart
and
put
it
in
then
i
done
the
same
with
the
side
of
bacon
then
the
i
took
all
the
coffee
and
sugar
there
was
and
all
the
ammunition
i
took
the
wadding
i
took
the
bucket
and
gourd
i
took
a
dipper
and
a
tin
cup
and
my
old
saw
and
two
blankets
and
the
skillet
and
the
i
took
and
matches
and
other
things
everything
that
was
worth
a
cent
i
cleaned
out
the
place
i
wanted
an
axe
but
there
any
only
the
one
out
at
the
woodpile
and
i
knowed
why
i
was
going
to
leave
that
i
fetched
out
the
gun
and
now
i
was
done
i
had
wore
the
ground
a
good
deal
crawling
out
of
the
hole
and
dragging
out
so
many
things
so
i
fixed
that
as
good
as
i
could
from
the
outside
by
scattering
dust
on
the
place
which
covered
up
the
smoothness
and
the
sawdust
then
i
fixed
the
piece
of
log
back
into
its
place
and
put
two
rocks
under
it
and
one
against
it
to
hold
it
there
for
it
was
bent
up
at
that
place
and
quite
touch
ground
if
you
stood
four
or
five
foot
away
and
know
it
was
sawed
you
never
notice
it
and
besides
this
was
the
back
of
the
cabin
and
it
likely
anybody
would
go
fooling
around
there
it
was
all
grass
clear
to
the
canoe
so
i
left
a
track
i
followed
around
to
see
i
stood
on
the
bank
and
looked
out
over
the
river
all
safe
so
i
took
the
gun
and
went
up
a
piece
into
the
woods
and
was
hunting
around
for
some
birds
when
i
see
a
wild
pig
hogs
soon
went
wild
in
them
bottoms
after
they
had
got
away
from
the
prairie
farms
i
shot
this
fellow
and
took
him
into
camp
i
took
the
axe
and
smashed
in
the
door
i
beat
it
and
hacked
it
considerable
it
i
fetched
the
pig
in
and
took
him
back
nearly
to
the
table
and
hacked
into
his
throat
with
the
axe
and
laid
him
down
on
the
ground
to
bleed
i
say
ground
because
it
was
ground
hard
packed
and
no
boards
well
next
i
took
an
old
sack
and
put
a
lot
of
big
rocks
in
it
all
i
could
drag
and
i
started
it
from
the
pig
and
dragged
it
to
the
door
and
through
the
woods
down
to
the
river
and
dumped
it
in
and
down
it
sunk
out
of
sight
you
could
easy
see
that
something
had
been
dragged
over
the
ground
i
did
wish
tom
sawyer
was
there
i
knowed
he
would
take
an
interest
in
this
kind
of
business
and
throw
in
the
fancy
touches
nobody
could
spread
himself
like
tom
sawyer
in
such
a
thing
as
that
well
last
i
pulled
out
some
of
my
hair
and
blooded
the
axe
good
and
stuck
it
on
the
back
side
and
slung
the
axe
in
the
corner
then
i
took
up
the
pig
and
held
him
to
my
breast
with
my
jacket
so
he
drip
till
i
got
a
good
piece
below
the
house
and
then
dumped
him
into
the
river
now
i
thought
of
something
else
so
i
went
and
got
the
bag
of
meal
and
my
old
saw
out
of
the
canoe
and
fetched
them
to
the
house
i
took
the
bag
to
where
it
used
to
stand
and
ripped
a
hole
in
the
bottom
of
it
with
the
saw
for
there
no
knives
and
forks
on
the
place
pap
done
everything
with
his
about
the
cooking
then
i
carried
the
sack
about
a
hundred
yards
across
the
grass
and
through
the
willows
east
of
the
house
to
a
shallow
lake
that
was
five
mile
wide
and
full
of
rushes
and
ducks
too
you
might
say
in
the
season
there
was
a
slough
or
a
creek
leading
out
of
it
on
the
other
side
that
went
miles
away
i
know
where
but
it
go
to
the
river
the
meal
sifted
out
and
made
a
little
track
all
the
way
to
the
lake
i
dropped
whetstone
there
too
so
as
to
look
like
it
had
been
done
by
accident
then
i
tied
up
the
rip
in
the
meal
sack
with
a
string
so
it
leak
no
more
and
took
it
and
my
saw
to
the
canoe
again
it
was
about
dark
now
so
i
dropped
the
canoe
down
the
river
under
some
willows
that
hung
over
the
bank
and
waited
for
the
moon
to
rise
i
made
fast
to
a
willow
then
i
took
a
bite
to
eat
and
by
and
by
laid
down
in
the
canoe
to
smoke
a
pipe
and
lay
out
a
plan
i
says
to
myself
follow
the
track
of
that
sackful
of
rocks
to
the
shore
and
then
drag
the
river
for
me
and
follow
that
meal
track
to
the
lake
and
go
browsing
down
the
creek
that
leads
out
of
it
to
find
the
robbers
that
killed
me
and
took
the
things
they
ever
hunt
the
river
for
anything
but
my
dead
carcass
soon
get
tired
of
that
and
bother
no
more
about
me
all
right
i
can
stop
anywhere
i
want
to
island
is
good
enough
for
me
i
know
that
island
pretty
well
and
nobody
ever
comes
there
and
then
i
can
paddle
over
to
town
nights
and
slink
around
and
pick
up
things
i
want
the
place
i
was
pretty
tired
and
the
first
thing
i
knowed
i
was
asleep
when
i
woke
up
i
know
where
i
was
for
a
minute
i
set
up
and
looked
around
a
little
scared
then
i
remembered
the
river
looked
miles
and
miles
across
the
moon
was
so
bright
i
could
a
counted
the
drift
logs
that
went
along
black
and
still
hundreds
of
yards
out
from
shore
everything
was
dead
quiet
and
it
looked
late
and
smelt
late
you
know
what
i
mean
i
know
the
words
to
put
it
in
i
took
a
good
gap
and
a
stretch
and
was
just
going
to
unhitch
and
start
when
i
heard
a
sound
away
over
the
water
i
listened
pretty
soon
i
made
it
out
it
was
that
dull
kind
of
a
regular
sound
that
comes
from
oars
working
in
rowlocks
when
a
still
night
i
peeped
out
through
the
willow
branches
and
there
it
was
a
skiff
away
across
the
water
i
tell
how
many
was
in
it
it
kept
and
when
it
was
abreast
of
me
i
see
there
but
one
man
in
it
i
maybe
pap
though
i
expecting
him
he
dropped
below
me
with
the
current
and
by
and
by
he
came
up
shore
in
the
easy
water
and
he
went
by
so
close
i
could
a
reached
out
the
gun
and
touched
him
well
it
was
pap
sure
enough
and
sober
too
by
the
way
he
laid
his
oars
i
lose
no
time
the
next
minute
i
was
down
stream
soft
but
quick
in
the
shade
of
the
bank
i
made
two
mile
and
a
half
and
then
struck
out
a
quarter
of
a
mile
or
more
towards
the
middle
of
the
river
because
pretty
soon
i
would
be
passing
the
ferry
landing
and
people
might
see
me
and
hail
me
i
got
out
amongst
the
driftwood
and
then
laid
down
in
the
bottom
of
the
canoe
and
let
her
float
i
laid
there
and
had
a
good
rest
and
a
smoke
out
of
my
pipe
looking
away
into
the
sky
not
a
cloud
in
it
the
sky
looks
ever
so
deep
when
you
lay
down
on
your
back
in
the
moonshine
i
never
knowed
it
before
and
how
far
a
body
can
hear
on
the
water
such
nights
i
heard
people
talking
at
the
ferry
landing
i
heard
what
they
said
too
every
word
of
it
one
man
said
it
was
getting
towards
the
long
days
and
the
short
nights
now
one
said
this
one
of
the
short
ones
he
reckoned
and
then
they
laughed
and
he
said
it
over
again
and
they
laughed
again
then
they
waked
up
another
fellow
and
told
him
and
laughed
but
he
laugh
he
ripped
out
something
brisk
and
said
let
him
alone
the
first
fellow
said
he
to
tell
it
to
his
old
woman
she
would
think
it
was
pretty
good
but
he
said
that
nothing
to
some
things
he
had
said
in
his
time
i
heard
one
man
say
it
was
nearly
three
and
he
hoped
daylight
wait
more
than
about
a
week
longer
after
that
the
talk
got
further
and
further
away
and
i
make
out
the
words
any
more
but
i
could
hear
the
mumble
and
now
and
then
a
laugh
too
but
it
seemed
a
long
ways
off
i
was
away
below
the
ferry
now
i
rose
up
and
there
was
island
about
two
mile
and
a
half
down
stream
heavy
timbered
and
standing
up
out
of
the
middle
of
the
river
big
and
dark
and
solid
like
a
steamboat
without
any
lights
there
any
signs
of
the
bar
at
the
head
it
was
all
under
water
now
it
take
me
long
to
get
there
i
shot
past
the
head
at
a
ripping
rate
the
current
was
so
swift
and
then
i
got
into
the
dead
water
and
landed
on
the
side
towards
the
illinois
shore
i
run
the
canoe
into
a
deep
dent
in
the
bank
that
i
knowed
about
i
had
to
part
the
willow
branches
to
get
in
and
when
i
made
fast
nobody
could
a
seen
the
canoe
from
the
outside
i
went
up
and
set
down
on
a
log
at
the
head
of
the
island
and
looked
out
on
the
big
river
and
the
black
driftwood
and
away
over
to
the
town
three
mile
away
where
there
was
three
or
four
lights
twinkling
a
monstrous
big
was
about
a
mile
up
stream
coming
along
down
with
a
lantern
in
the
middle
of
it
i
watched
it
come
creeping
down
and
when
it
was
most
abreast
of
where
i
stood
i
heard
a
man
say
stern
oars
there
heave
her
head
to
stabboard
i
heard
that
just
as
plain
as
if
the
man
was
by
my
side
there
was
a
little
gray
in
the
sky
now
so
i
stepped
into
the
woods
and
laid
down
for
a
nap
before
breakfast
chapter
viii
the
sun
was
up
so
high
when
i
waked
that
i
judged
it
was
after
eight
i
laid
there
in
the
grass
and
the
cool
shade
thinking
about
things
and
feeling
rested
and
ruther
comfortable
and
satisfied
i
could
see
the
sun
out
at
one
or
two
holes
but
mostly
it
was
big
trees
all
about
and
gloomy
in
there
amongst
them
there
was
freckled
places
on
the
ground
where
the
light
sifted
down
through
the
leaves
and
the
freckled
places
swapped
about
a
little
showing
there
was
a
little
breeze
up
there
a
couple
of
squirrels
set
on
a
limb
and
jabbered
at
me
very
friendly
i
was
powerful
lazy
and
comfortable
want
to
get
up
and
cook
breakfast
well
i
was
dozing
off
again
when
i
thinks
i
hears
a
deep
sound
of
boom
away
up
the
river
i
rouses
up
and
rests
on
my
elbow
and
listens
pretty
soon
i
hears
it
again
i
hopped
up
and
went
and
looked
out
at
a
hole
in
the
leaves
and
i
see
a
bunch
of
smoke
laying
on
the
water
a
long
ways
up
about
abreast
the
ferry
and
there
was
the
ferryboat
full
of
people
floating
along
down
i
knowed
what
was
the
matter
now
boom
i
see
the
white
smoke
squirt
out
of
the
side
you
see
they
was
firing
cannon
over
the
water
trying
to
make
my
carcass
come
to
the
top
i
was
pretty
hungry
but
it
going
to
do
for
me
to
start
a
fire
because
they
might
see
the
smoke
so
i
set
there
and
watched
the
and
listened
to
the
boom
the
river
was
a
mile
wide
there
and
it
always
looks
pretty
on
a
summer
morning
so
i
was
having
a
good
enough
time
seeing
them
hunt
for
my
remainders
if
i
only
had
a
bite
to
eat
well
then
i
happened
to
think
how
they
always
put
quicksilver
in
loaves
of
bread
and
float
them
off
because
they
always
go
right
to
the
drownded
carcass
and
stop
there
so
says
i
keep
a
lookout
and
if
any
of
floating
around
after
me
give
them
a
show
i
changed
to
the
illinois
edge
of
the
island
to
see
what
luck
i
could
have
and
i
disappointed
a
big
double
loaf
come
along
and
i
most
got
it
with
a
long
stick
but
my
foot
slipped
and
she
floated
out
further
of
course
i
was
where
the
current
set
in
the
closest
to
the
shore
i
knowed
enough
for
that
but
by
and
by
along
comes
another
one
and
this
time
i
won
i
took
out
the
plug
and
shook
out
the
little
dab
of
quicksilver
and
set
my
teeth
in
it
was
bread
what
the
quality
eat
none
of
your
i
got
a
good
place
amongst
the
leaves
and
set
there
on
a
log
munching
the
bread
and
watching
the
and
very
well
satisfied
and
then
something
struck
me
i
says
now
i
reckon
the
widow
or
the
parson
or
somebody
prayed
that
this
bread
would
find
me
and
here
it
has
gone
and
done
it
so
there
no
doubt
but
there
is
something
in
that
thing
that
is
something
in
it
when
a
body
like
the
widow
or
the
parson
prays
but
it
work
for
me
and
i
reckon
it
work
for
only
just
the
right
kind
i
lit
a
pipe
and
had
a
good
long
smoke
and
went
on
watching
the
ferryboat
was
floating
with
the
current
and
i
allowed
have
a
chance
to
see
who
was
aboard
when
she
come
along
because
she
would
come
in
close
where
the
bread
did
when
got
pretty
well
along
down
towards
me
i
put
out
my
pipe
and
went
to
where
i
fished
out
the
bread
and
laid
down
behind
a
log
on
the
bank
in
a
little
open
place
where
the
log
forked
i
could
peep
through
by
and
by
she
come
along
and
she
drifted
in
so
close
that
they
could
a
run
out
a
plank
and
walked
ashore
most
everybody
was
on
the
boat
pap
and
judge
thatcher
and
bessie
thatcher
and
jo
harper
and
tom
sawyer
and
his
old
aunt
polly
and
sid
and
mary
and
plenty
more
everybody
was
talking
about
the
murder
but
the
captain
broke
in
and
says
look
sharp
now
the
current
sets
in
the
closest
here
and
maybe
washed
ashore
and
got
tangled
amongst
the
brush
at
the
edge
i
hope
so
anyway
i
hope
so
they
all
crowded
up
and
leaned
over
the
rails
nearly
in
my
face
and
kept
still
watching
with
all
their
might
i
could
see
them
but
they
see
me
then
the
captain
sung
out
stand
away
and
the
cannon
let
off
such
a
blast
right
before
me
that
it
made
me
deef
with
the
noise
and
pretty
near
blind
with
the
smoke
and
i
judged
i
was
gone
if
a
had
some
bullets
in
i
reckon
a
got
the
corpse
they
was
after
well
i
see
i
hurt
thanks
to
goodness
the
boat
floated
on
and
went
out
of
sight
around
the
shoulder
of
the
island
i
could
hear
the
booming
now
and
then
further
and
further
off
and
by
and
by
after
an
hour
i
hear
it
no
more
the
island
was
three
mile
long
i
judged
they
had
got
to
the
foot
and
was
giving
it
up
but
they
yet
a
while
they
turned
around
the
foot
of
the
island
and
started
up
the
channel
on
the
missouri
side
under
steam
and
booming
once
in
a
while
as
they
went
i
crossed
over
to
that
side
and
watched
them
when
they
got
abreast
the
head
of
the
island
they
quit
shooting
and
dropped
over
to
the
missouri
shore
and
went
home
to
the
town
i
knowed
i
was
all
right
now
nobody
else
would
come
after
me
i
got
my
traps
out
of
the
canoe
and
made
me
a
nice
camp
in
the
thick
woods
i
made
a
kind
of
a
tent
out
of
my
blankets
to
put
my
things
under
so
the
rain
get
at
them
i
catched
a
catfish
and
haggled
him
open
with
my
saw
and
towards
sundown
i
started
my
camp
fire
and
had
supper
then
i
set
out
a
line
to
catch
some
fish
for
breakfast
when
it
was
dark
i
set
by
my
camp
fire
smoking
and
feeling
pretty
well
satisfied
but
by
and
by
it
got
sort
of
lonesome
and
so
i
went
and
set
on
the
bank
and
listened
to
the
current
swashing
along
and
counted
the
stars
and
drift
logs
and
rafts
that
come
down
and
then
went
to
bed
there
no
better
way
to
put
in
time
when
you
are
lonesome
you
stay
so
you
soon
get
over
it
and
so
for
three
days
and
nights
no
difference
just
the
same
thing
but
the
next
day
i
went
exploring
around
down
through
the
island
i
was
boss
of
it
it
all
belonged
to
me
so
to
say
and
i
wanted
to
know
all
about
it
but
mainly
i
wanted
to
put
in
the
time
i
found
plenty
strawberries
ripe
and
prime
and
green
summer
grapes
and
green
razberries
and
the
green
blackberries
was
just
beginning
to
show
they
would
all
come
handy
by
and
by
i
judged
well
i
went
fooling
along
in
the
deep
woods
till
i
judged
i
far
from
the
foot
of
the
island
i
had
my
gun
along
but
i
shot
nothing
it
was
for
protection
thought
i
would
kill
some
game
nigh
home
about
this
time
i
mighty
near
stepped
on
a
snake
and
it
went
sliding
off
through
the
grass
and
flowers
and
i
after
it
trying
to
get
a
shot
at
it
i
clipped
along
and
all
of
a
sudden
i
bounded
right
on
to
the
ashes
of
a
camp
fire
that
was
still
smoking
my
heart
jumped
up
amongst
my
lungs
i
never
waited
for
to
look
further
but
uncocked
my
gun
and
went
sneaking
back
on
my
tiptoes
as
fast
as
ever
i
could
every
now
and
then
i
stopped
a
second
amongst
the
thick
leaves
and
listened
but
my
breath
come
so
hard
i
hear
nothing
else
i
slunk
along
another
piece
further
then
listened
again
and
so
on
and
so
on
if
i
see
a
stump
i
took
it
for
a
man
if
i
trod
on
a
stick
and
broke
it
it
made
me
feel
like
a
person
had
cut
one
of
my
breaths
in
two
and
i
only
got
half
and
the
short
half
too
when
i
got
to
camp
i
feeling
very
brash
there
much
sand
in
my
craw
but
i
says
this
no
time
to
be
fooling
around
so
i
got
all
my
traps
into
my
canoe
again
so
as
to
have
them
out
of
sight
and
i
put
out
the
fire
and
scattered
the
ashes
around
to
look
like
an
old
last
camp
and
then
clumb
a
tree
i
reckon
i
was
up
in
the
tree
two
hours
but
i
see
nothing
i
hear
nothing
i
only
thought
i
heard
and
seen
as
much
as
a
thousand
things
well
i
stay
up
there
forever
so
at
last
i
got
down
but
i
kept
in
the
thick
woods
and
on
the
lookout
all
the
time
all
i
could
get
to
eat
was
berries
and
what
was
left
over
from
breakfast
by
the
time
it
was
night
i
was
pretty
hungry
so
when
it
was
good
and
dark
i
slid
out
from
shore
before
moonrise
and
paddled
over
to
the
illinois
bank
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
i
went
out
in
the
woods
and
cooked
a
supper
and
i
had
about
made
up
my
mind
i
would
stay
there
all
night
when
i
hear
a
and
says
to
myself
horses
coming
and
next
i
hear
voices
i
got
everything
into
the
canoe
as
quick
as
i
could
and
then
went
creeping
through
the
woods
to
see
what
i
could
find
out
i
got
far
when
i
hear
a
man
say
we
better
camp
here
if
we
can
find
a
good
place
the
horses
is
about
beat
out
look
around
i
wait
but
shoved
out
and
paddled
away
easy
i
tied
up
in
the
old
place
and
reckoned
i
would
sleep
in
the
canoe
i
sleep
much
i
somehow
for
thinking
and
every
time
i
waked
up
i
thought
somebody
had
me
by
the
neck
so
the
sleep
do
me
no
good
by
and
by
i
says
to
myself
i
live
this
way
to
find
out
who
it
is
here
on
the
island
with
me
find
it
out
or
bust
well
i
felt
better
right
off
so
i
took
my
paddle
and
slid
out
from
shore
just
a
step
or
two
and
then
let
the
canoe
drop
along
down
amongst
the
shadows
the
moon
was
shining
and
outside
of
the
shadows
it
made
it
most
as
light
as
day
i
poked
along
well
on
to
an
hour
everything
still
as
rocks
and
sound
asleep
well
by
this
time
i
was
most
down
to
the
foot
of
the
island
a
little
ripply
cool
breeze
begun
to
blow
and
that
was
as
good
as
saying
the
night
was
about
done
i
give
her
a
turn
with
the
paddle
and
brung
her
nose
to
shore
then
i
got
my
gun
and
slipped
out
and
into
the
edge
of
the
woods
i
sat
down
there
on
a
log
and
looked
out
through
the
leaves
i
see
the
moon
go
off
watch
and
the
darkness
begin
to
blanket
the
river
but
in
a
little
while
i
see
a
pale
streak
over
the
treetops
and
knowed
the
day
was
coming
so
i
took
my
gun
and
slipped
off
towards
where
i
had
run
across
that
camp
fire
stopping
every
minute
or
two
to
listen
but
i
no
luck
somehow
i
seem
to
find
the
place
but
by
and
by
sure
enough
i
catched
a
glimpse
of
fire
away
through
the
trees
i
went
for
it
cautious
and
slow
by
and
by
i
was
close
enough
to
have
a
look
and
there
laid
a
man
on
the
ground
it
most
give
me
the
fantods
he
had
a
blanket
around
his
head
and
his
head
was
nearly
in
the
fire
i
set
there
behind
a
clump
of
bushes
in
about
six
foot
of
him
and
kept
my
eyes
on
him
steady
it
was
getting
gray
daylight
now
pretty
soon
he
gapped
and
stretched
himself
and
hove
off
the
blanket
and
it
was
miss
jim
i
bet
i
was
glad
to
see
him
i
says
hello
jim
and
skipped
out
he
bounced
up
and
stared
at
me
wild
then
he
drops
down
on
his
knees
and
puts
his
hands
together
and
says

all
the

did
you

shooting
the
cannon
oh

heah
watched
um
thoo
de
bushes
some
young
birds
come
along
flying
a
yard
or
two
at
a
time
and
lighting
jim
said
it
was
a
sign
it
was
going
to
rain
he
said
it
was
a
sign
when
young
chickens
flew
that
way
and
so
he
reckoned
it
was
the
same
way
when
young
birds
done
it
i
was
going
to
catch
some
of
them
but
jim
let
me
he
said
it
was
death
he
said
his
father
laid
mighty
sick
once
and
some
of
them
catched
a
bird
and
his
old
granny
said
his
father
would
die
and
he
did
and
jim
said
you
count
the
things
you
are
going
to
cook
for
dinner
because
that
would
bring
bad
luck
the
same
if
you
shook
the
after
sundown
and
he
said
if
a
man
owned
a
beehive
and
that
man
died
the
bees
must
be
told
about
it
before
next
morning
or
else
the
bees
would
all
weaken
down
and
quit
work
and
die
jim
said
bees
sting
idiots
but
i
believe
that
because
i
had
tried
them
lots
of
times
myself
and
they
sting
me
i
had
heard
about
some
of
these
things
before
but
not
all
of
them
jim
knowed

said
he
knowed
most
everything
i
said
it
looked
to
me
like
all
the
signs
was
about
bad
luck
and
so
i
asked
him
if
there
any
signs
he
says
mighty
few
dey
no
use
to
a
body
what
you
want
to

it
i
owns
mysef
en
wuth
eight
dollars
i
wisht
i
had
de
money
i
want
no
chapter
ix
i
wanted
to
go
and
look
at
a
place
right
about
the
middle
of
the
island
that
found
when
i
was
exploring
so
we
started
and
soon
got
to
it
because
the
island
was
only
three
miles
long
and
a
quarter
of
a
mile
wide
this
place
was
a
tolerable
long
steep
hill
or
ridge
about
forty
foot
high
we
had
a
rough
time
getting
to
the
top
the
sides
was
so
steep
and
the
bushes
so
thick
we
tramped
and
clumb
around
all
over
it
and
by
and
by
found
a
good
big
cavern
in
the
rock
most
up
to
the
top
on
the
side
towards
illinois
the
cavern
was
as
big
as
two
or
three
rooms
bunched
together
and
jim
could
stand
up
straight
in
it
it
was
cool
in
there
jim
was
for
putting
our
traps
in
there
right
away
but
i
said
we
want
to
be
climbing
up
and
down
there
all
the
time
jim
said
if
we
had
the
canoe
hid
in
a
good
place
and
had
all
the
traps
in
the
cavern
we
could
rush
there
if
anybody
was
to
come
to
the
island
and
they
would
never
find
us
without
dogs
and
besides
he
said
them
little
birds
had
said
it
was
going
to
rain
and
did
i
want
the
things
to
get
wet
so
we
went
back
and
got
the
canoe
and
paddled
up
abreast
the
cavern
and
lugged
all
the
traps
up
there
then
we
hunted
up
a
place
close
by
to
hide
the
canoe
in
amongst
the
thick
willows
we
took
some
fish
off
of
the
lines
and
set
them
again
and
begun
to
get
ready
for
dinner
the
door
of
the
cavern
was
big
enough
to
roll
a
hogshead
in
and
on
one
side
of
the
door
the
floor
stuck
out
a
little
bit
and
was
flat
and
a
good
place
to
build
a
fire
on
so
we
built
it
there
and
cooked
dinner
we
spread
the
blankets
inside
for
a
carpet
and
eat
our
dinner
in
there
we
put
all
the
other
things
handy
at
the
back
of
the
cavern
pretty
soon
it
darkened
up
and
begun
to
thunder
and
lighten
so
the
birds
was
right
about
it
directly
it
begun
to
rain
and
it
rained
like
all
fury
too
and
i
never
see
the
wind
blow
so
it
was
one
of
these
regular
summer
storms
it
would
get
so
dark
that
it
looked
all
outside
and
lovely
and
the
rain
would
thrash
along
by
so
thick
that
the
trees
off
a
little
ways
looked
dim
and
and
here
would
come
a
blast
of
wind
that
would
bend
the
trees
down
and
turn
up
the
pale
underside
of
the
leaves
and
then
a
perfect
ripper
of
a
gust
would
follow
along
and
set
the
branches
to
tossing
their
arms
as
if
they
was
just
wild
and
next
when
it
was
just
about
the
bluest
and
blackest
fst
it
was
as
bright
as
glory
and
have
a
little
glimpse
of
about
away
off
yonder
in
the
storm
hundreds
of
yards
further
than
you
could
see
before
dark
as
sin
again
in
a
second
and
now
hear
the
thunder
let
go
with
an
awful
crash
and
then
go
rumbling
grumbling
tumbling
down
the
sky
towards
the
under
side
of
the
world
like
rolling
empty
barrels
down
stairs
where
long
stairs
and
they
bounce
a
good
deal
you
know
jim
this
is
nice
i
says
i
want
to
be
nowhere
else
but
here
pass
me
along
another
hunk
of
fish
and
some
hot
well
you
a
ben
here
it
a
ben
for
jim
a
ben
down
dah
in
de
woods
widout
any
dinner
en
drownded
too
dat
you
would
honey
chickens
knows
when
gwyne
to
rain
en
so
do
de
birds
chile
the
river
went
on
raising
and
raising
for
ten
or
twelve
days
till
at
last
it
was
over
the
banks
the
water
was
three
or
four
foot
deep
on
the
island
in
the
low
places
and
on
the
illinois
bottom
on
that
side
it
was
a
good
many
miles
wide
but
on
the
missouri
side
it
was
the
same
old
distance
across
a
half
a
mile
because
the
missouri
shore
was
just
a
wall
of
high
bluffs
daytimes
we
paddled
all
over
the
island
in
the
canoe
it
was
mighty
cool
and
shady
in
the
deep
woods
even
if
the
sun
was
blazing
outside
we
went
winding
in
and
out
amongst
the
trees
and
sometimes
the
vines
hung
so
thick
we
had
to
back
away
and
go
some
other
way
well
on
every
old
tree
you
could
see
rabbits
and
snakes
and
such
things
and
when
the
island
had
been
overflowed
a
day
or
two
they
got
so
tame
on
account
of
being
hungry
that
you
could
paddle
right
up
and
put
your
hand
on
them
if
you
wanted
to
but
not
the
snakes
and
turtles
they
would
slide
off
in
the
water
the
ridge
our
cavern
was
in
was
full
of
them
we
could
a
had
pets
enough
if
wanted
them
one
night
we
catched
a
little
section
of
a
lumber
raft
nice
pine
planks
it
was
twelve
foot
wide
and
about
fifteen
or
sixteen
foot
long
and
the
top
stood
above
water
six
or
seven
inches
a
solid
level
floor
we
could
see
go
by
in
the
daylight
sometimes
but
we
let
them
go
we
show
ourselves
in
daylight
another
night
when
we
was
up
at
the
head
of
the
island
just
before
daylight
here

a
down
on
the
west
side
she
was
a
and
tilted
over
considerable
we
paddled
out
and
got
aboard
clumb
in
at
an
upstairs
window
but
it
was
too
dark
to
see
yet
so
we
made
the
canoe
fast
and
set
in
her
to
wait
for
daylight
the
light
begun
to
come
before
we
got
to
the
foot
of
the
island
then
we
looked
in
at
the
window
we
could
make
out
a
bed
and
a
table
and
two
old
chairs
and
lots
of
things
around
about
on
the
floor
and
there
was
clothes
hanging
against
the
wall
there
was
something
laying
on
the
floor
in
the
far
corner
that
looked
like
a
man
so
jim
says
hello

but
it
budge
so
i
hollered
again
and
then
jim
says
de
man
asleep

hold
still
go
en
see
he
went
and
bent
down
and
looked
and
says

dead
man
yes

naked
too
ben
shot
in
de
back
i
ben
dead
two
er
three
days
come
in
huck
but
look
at
his
face
too
gashly
i
look
at
him
at
all
jim
throwed
some
old
rags
over
him
but
he
done
it
i
want
to
see
him
there
was
heaps
of
old
greasy
cards
scattered
around
over
the
floor
and
old
whisky
bottles
and
a
couple
of
masks
made
out
of
black
cloth
and
all
over
the
walls
was
the
ignorantest
kind
of
words
and
pictures
made
with
charcoal
there
was
two
old
dirty
calico
dresses
and
a
and
some
underclothes
hanging
against
the
wall
and
some
clothing
too
we
put
the
lot
into
the
canoe
it
might
come
good
there
was
a
old
speckled
straw
hat
on
the
floor
i
took
that
too
and
there
was
a
bottle
that
had
had
milk
in
it
and
it
had
a
rag
stopper
for
a
baby
to
suck
we
would
a
took
the
bottle
but
it
was
broke
there
was
a
seedy
old
chest
and
an
old
hair
trunk
with
the
hinges
broke
they
stood
open
but
there
nothing
left
in
them
that
was
any
account
the
way
things
was
scattered
about
we
reckoned
the
people
left
in
a
hurry
and
fixed
so
as
to
carry
off
most
of
their
stuff
we
got
an
old
tin
lantern
and
a
without
any
handle
and
a
barlow
knife
worth
two
bits
in
any
store
and
a
lot
of
tallow
candles
and
a
tin
candlestick
and
a
gourd
and
a
tin
cup
and
a
ratty
old
bedquilt
off
the
bed
and
a
reticule
with
needles
and
pins
and
beeswax
and
buttons
and
thread
and
all
such
truck
in
it
and
a
hatchet
and
some
nails
and
a
fishline
as
thick
as
my
little
finger
with
some
monstrous
hooks
on
it
and
a
roll
of
buckskin
and
a
leather
and
a
horseshoe
and
some
vials
of
medicine
that
have
no
label
on
them
and
just
as
we
was
leaving
i
found
a
tolerable
good
and
jim
he
found
a
ratty
old
and
a
wooden
leg
the
straps
was
broke
off
of
it
but
barring
that
it
was
a
good
enough
leg
though
it
was
too
long
for
me
and
not
long
enough
for
jim
and
we
find
the
other
one
though
we
hunted
all
around
and
so
take
it
all
around
we
made
a
good
haul
when
we
was
ready
to
shove
off
we
was
a
quarter
of
a
mile
below
the
island
and
it
was
pretty
broad
day
so
i
made
jim
lay
down
in
the
canoe
and
cover
up
with
the
quilt
because
if
he
set
up
people
could
tell
he
was
a
nigger
a
good
ways
off
i
paddled
over
to
the
illinois
shore
and
drifted
down
most
a
half
a
mile
doing
it
i
crept
up
the
dead
water
under
the
bank
and
no
accidents
and
see
nobody
we
got
home
all
safe
chapter
x
after
breakfast
i
wanted
to
talk
about
the
dead
man
and
guess
out
how
he
come
to
be
killed
but
jim
want
to
he
said
it
would
fetch
bad
luck
and
besides
he
said
he
might
come
and
us
he
said
a
man
that
buried
was
more
likely
to
go
around
than
one
that
was
planted
and
comfortable
that
sounded
pretty
reasonable
so
i
say
no
more
but
i
keep
from
studying
over
it
and
wishing
i
knowed
who
shot
the
man
and
what
they
done
it
for
we
rummaged
the
clothes
got
and
found
eight
dollars
in
silver
sewed
up
in
the
lining
of
an
old
blanket
overcoat
jim
said
he
reckoned
the
people
in
that
house
stole
the
coat
because
if
a
knowed
the
money
was
there
they
a
left
it
i
said
i
reckoned
they
killed
him
too
but
jim
want
to
talk
about
that
i
says
now
you
think
bad
luck
but
what
did
you
say
when
i
fetched
in
the
that
i
found
on
the
top
of
the
ridge
day
before
yesterday
you
said
it
was
the
worst
bad
luck
in
the
world
to
touch
a
with
my
hands
well
your
bad
luck
raked
in
all
this
truck
and
eight
dollars
besides
i
wish
we
could
have
some
bad
luck
like
this
every
day
jim
never
you
mind
honey
never
you
mind
you
git
too
peart
mind
i
tell
you
it
did
come
too
it
was
a
tuesday
that
we
had
that
talk
well
after
dinner
friday
we
was
laying
around
in
the
grass
at
the
upper
end
of
the
ridge
and
got
out
of
tobacco
i
went
to
the
cavern
to
get
some
and
found
a
rattlesnake
in
there
i
killed
him
and
curled
him
up
on
the
foot
of
blanket
ever
so
natural
thinking
be
some
fun
when
jim
found
him
there
well
by
night
i
forgot
all
about
the
snake
and
when
jim
flung
himself
down
on
the
blanket
while
i
struck
a
light
the
mate
was
there
and
bit
him
he
jumped
up
yelling
and
the
first
thing
the
light
showed
was
the
varmint
curled
up
and
ready
for
another
spring
i
laid
him
out
in
a
second
with
a
stick
and
jim
grabbed
and
begun
to
pour
it
down
he
was
barefooted
and
the
snake
bit
him
right
on
the
heel
that
all
comes
of
my
being
such
a
fool
as
to
not
remember
that
wherever
you
leave
a
dead
snake
its
mate
always
comes
there
and
curls
around
it
jim
told
me
to
chop
off
the
head
and
throw
it
away
and
then
skin
the
body
and
roast
a
piece
of
it
i
done
it
and
he
eat
it
and
said
it
would
help
cure
him
he
made
me
take
off
the
rattles
and
tie
them
around
his
wrist
too
he
said
that
that
would
help
then
i
slid
out
quiet
and
throwed
the
snakes
clear
away
amongst
the
bushes
for
i
going
to
let
jim
find
out
it
was
all
my
fault
not
if
i
could
help
it
jim
sucked
and
sucked
at
the
jug
and
now
and
then
he
got
out
of
his
head
and
pitched
around
and
yelled
but
every
time
he
come
to
himself
he
went
to
sucking
at
the
jug
again
his
foot
swelled
up
pretty
big
and
so
did
his
leg
but
by
and
by
the
drunk
begun
to
come
and
so
i
judged
he
was
all
right
but
druther
been
bit
with
a
snake
than
whisky
jim
was
laid
up
for
four
days
and
nights
then
the
swelling
was
all
gone
and
he
was
around
again
i
made
up
my
mind
i
ever
take
of
a
again
with
my
hands
now
that
i
see
what
had
come
of
it
jim
said
he
reckoned
i
would
believe
him
next
time
and
he
said
that
handling
a
was
such
awful
bad
luck
that
maybe
we
got
to
the
end
of
it
yet
he
said
he
druther
see
the
new
moon
over
his
left
shoulder
as
much
as
a
thousand
times
than
take
up
a
in
his
hand
well
i
was
getting
to
feel
that
way
myself
though
always
reckoned
that
looking
at
the
new
moon
over
your
left
shoulder
is
one
of
the
carelessest
and
foolishest
things
a
body
can
do
old
hank
bunker
done
it
once
and
bragged
about
it
and
in
less
than
two
years
he
got
drunk
and
fell
off
of
the
and
spread
himself
out
so
that
he
was
just
a
kind
of
a
layer
as
you
may
say
and
they
slid
him
edgeways
between
two
barn
doors
for
a
coffin
and
buried
him
so
so
they
say
but
i
see
it
pap
told
me
but
anyway
it
all
come
of
looking
at
the
moon
that
way
like
a
fool
well
the
days
went
along
and
the
river
went
down
between
its
banks
again
and
about
the
first
thing
we
done
was
to
bait
one
of
the
big
hooks
with
a
skinned
rabbit
and
set
it
and
catch
a
catfish
that
was
as
big
as
a
man
being
six
foot
two
inches
long
and
weighed
over
two
hundred
pounds
we
handle
him
of
course
he
would
a
flung
us
into
illinois
we
just
set
there
and
watched
him
rip
and
tear
around
till
he
drownded
we
found
a
brass
button
in
his
stomach
and
a
round
ball
and
lots
of
rubbage
we
split
the
ball
open
with
the
hatchet
and
there
was
a
spool
in
it
jim
said
had
it
there
a
long
time
to
coat
it
over
so
and
make
a
ball
of
it
it
was
as
big
a
fish
as
was
ever
catched
in
the
mississippi
i
reckon
jim
said
he
ever
seen
a
bigger
one
he
would
a
been
worth
a
good
deal
over
at
the
village
they
peddle
out
such
a
fish
as
that
by
the
pound
in
the
there
everybody
buys
some
of
him
his
as
white
as
snow
and
makes
a
good
fry
next
morning
i
said
it
was
getting
slow
and
dull
and
i
wanted
to
get
a
stirring
up
some
way
i
said
i
reckoned
i
would
slip
over
the
river
and
find
out
what
was
going
on
jim
liked
that
notion
but
he
said
i
must
go
in
the
dark
and
look
sharp
then
he
studied
it
over
and
said
i
put
on
some
of
them
old
things
and
dress
up
like
a
girl
that
was
a
good
notion
too
so
we
shortened
up
one
of
the
calico
gowns
and
i
turned
up
my
to
my
knees
and
got
into
it
jim
hitched
it
behind
with
the
hooks
and
it
was
a
fair
fit
i
put
on
the
and
tied
it
under
my
chin
and
then
for
a
body
to
look
in
and
see
my
face
was
like
looking
down
a
joint
of
jim
said
nobody
would
know
me
even
in
the
daytime
hardly
i
practiced
around
all
day
to
get
the
hang
of
the
things
and
by
and
by
i
could
do
pretty
well
in
them
only
jim
said
i
walk
like
a
girl
and
he
said
i
must
quit
pulling
up
my
gown
to
get
at
my
i
took
notice
and
done
better
i
started
up
the
illinois
shore
in
the
canoe
just
after
dark
i
started
across
to
the
town
from
a
little
below
the
and
the
drift
of
the
current
fetched
me
in
at
the
bottom
of
the
town
i
tied
up
and
started
along
the
bank
there
was
a
light
burning
in
a
little
shanty
that
been
lived
in
for
a
long
time
and
i
wondered
who
had
took
up
quarters
there
i
slipped
up
and
peeped
in
at
the
window
there
was
a
woman
about
forty
year
old
in
there
knitting
by
a
candle
that
was
on
a
pine
table
i
know
her
face
she
was
a
stranger
for
you
start
a
face
in
that
town
that
i
know
now
this
was
lucky
because
i
was
weakening
i
was
getting
afraid
i
had
come
people
might
know
my
voice
and
find
me
out
but
if
this
woman
had
been
in
such
a
little
town
two
days
she
could
tell
me
all
i
wanted
to
know
so
i
knocked
at
the
door
and
made
up
my
mind
i
forget
i
was
a
girl
chapter
xi
come
in
says
the
woman
and
i
did
she
says
take
a
cheer
i
done
it
she
looked
me
all
over
with
her
little
shiny
eyes
and
says
what
might
your
name
be
sarah
williams
where
do
you
live
in
this
neighborhood
in
hookerville
seven
mile
below
walked
all
the
way
and
all
tired
out
hungry
too
i
reckon
find
you
something
i
hungry
i
was
so
hungry
i
had
to
stop
two
miles
below
here
at
a
farm
so
i
hungry
no
more
what
makes
me
so
late
my
down
sick
and
out
of
money
and
everything
and
i
come
to
tell
my
uncle
abner
moore
he
lives
at
the
upper
end
of
the
town
she
says
i
ever
been
here
before
do
you
know
him
no
but
i
know
everybody
yet
i
lived
here
quite
two
weeks
a
considerable
ways
to
the
upper
end
of
the
town
you
better
stay
here
all
night
take
off
your
bonnet
no
i
says
rest
a
while
i
reckon
and
go
on
i
afeared
of
the
dark
she
said
she
let
me
go
by
myself
but
her
husband
would
be
in
by
and
by
maybe
in
a
hour
and
a
half
and
send
him
along
with
me
then
she
got
to
talking
about
her
husband
and
about
her
relations
up
the
river
and
her
relations
down
the
river
and
about
how
much
better
off
they
used
to
was
and
how
they
know
but
made
a
mistake
coming
to
our
town
instead
of
letting
well
alone
and
so
on
and
so
on
till
i
was
afeard
i
had
made
a
mistake
coming
to
her
to
find
out
what
was
going
on
in
the
town
but
by
and
by
she
dropped
on
to
pap
and
the
murder
and
then
i
was
pretty
willing
to
let
her
clatter
right
along
she
told
about
me
and
tom
sawyer
finding
the
six
thousand
dollars
only
she
got
it
ten
and
all
about
pap
and
what
a
hard
lot
he
was
and
what
a
hard
lot
i
was
and
at
last
she
got
down
to
where
i
was
murdered
i
says
who
done
it
heard
considerable
about
these
goings
on
down
in
hookerville
but
we
know
who
that
killed
huck
finn
well
i
reckon
a
right
smart
chance
of
people
here
like
to
know
who
killed
him
some
think
old
finn
done
it
himself
no
is
that
so
most
everybody
thought
it
at
first
never
know
how
nigh
he
come
to
getting
lynched
but
before
night
they
changed
around
and
judged
it
was
done
by
a
runaway
nigger
named
jim
why
he
i
stopped
i
reckoned
i
better
keep
still
she
run
on
and
never
noticed
i
had
put
in
at
all
the
nigger
run
off
the
very
night
huck
finn
was
killed
so
a
reward
out
for
him
three
hundred
dollars
and
a
reward
out
for
old
finn
too
two
hundred
dollars
you
see
he
come
to
town
the
morning
after
the
murder
and
told
about
it
and
was
out
with
on
the
ferryboat
hunt
and
right
away
after
he
up
and
left
before
night
they
wanted
to
lynch
him
but
he
was
gone
you
see
well
next
day
they
found
out
the
nigger
was
gone
they
found
out
he
ben
seen
sence
ten
the
night
the
murder
was
done
so
then
they
put
it
on
him
you
see
and
while
they
was
full
of
it
next
day
back
comes
old
finn
and
went
to
judge
thatcher
to
get
money
to
hunt
for
the
nigger
all
over
illinois
with
the
judge
gave
him
some
and
that
evening
he
got
drunk
and
was
around
till
after
midnight
with
a
couple
of
mighty
strangers
and
then
went
off
with
them
well
he
come
back
sence
and
they
looking
for
him
back
till
this
thing
blows
over
a
little
for
people
thinks
now
that
he
killed
his
boy
and
fixed
things
so
folks
would
think
robbers
done
it
and
then
get
money
without
having
to
bother
a
long
time
with
a
lawsuit
people
do
say
he
any
too
good
to
do
it
oh
sly
i
reckon
if
he
come
back
for
a
year
be
all
right
you
prove
anything
on
him
you
know
everything
will
be
quieted
down
then
and
walk
in
money
as
easy
as
nothing
yes
i
reckon
so
i
see
nothing
in
the
way
of
it
has
everybody
quit
thinking
the
nigger
done
it
oh
no
not
everybody
a
good
many
thinks
he
done
it
but
get
the
nigger
pretty
soon
now
and
maybe
they
can
scare
it
out
of
him
why
are
they
after
him
yet
well
innocent
you
does
three
hundred
dollars
lay
around
every
day
for
people
to
pick
up
some
folks
think
the
nigger
far
from
here
one
of
them
but
i
talked
it
around
a
few
days
ago
i
was
talking
with
an
old
couple
that
lives
next
door
in
the
log
shanty
and
they
happened
to
say
hardly
anybody
ever
goes
to
that
island
over
yonder
that
they
call
island
anybody
live
there
says
i
no
nobody
says
they
i
say
any
more
but
i
done
some
thinking
i
was
pretty
near
certain
seen
smoke
over
there
about
the
head
of
the
island
a
day
or
two
before
that
so
i
says
to
myself
like
as
not
that
hiding
over
there
anyway
says
i
worth
the
trouble
to
give
the
place
a
hunt
i
seen
any
smoke
sence
so
i
reckon
maybe
gone
if
it
was
him
but
going
over
to
see
him
and
another
man
he
was
gone
up
the
river
but
he
got
back
and
i
told
him
as
soon
as
he
got
here
two
hours
ago
i
had
got
so
uneasy
i
set
still
i
had
to
do
something
with
my
hands
so
i
took
up
a
needle
off
of
the
table
and
went
to
threading
it
my
hands
shook
and
i
was
making
a
bad
job
of
it
when
the
woman
stopped
talking
i
looked
up
and
she
was
looking
at
me
pretty
curious
and
smiling
a
little
i
put
down
the
needle
and
thread
and
let
on
to
be
interested
and
i
was
too
and
says
three
hundred
dollars
is
a
power
of
money
i
wish
my
mother
could
get
it
is
your
husband
going
over
there
oh
yes
he
went
with
the
man
i
was
telling
you
of
to
get
a
boat
and
see
if
they
could
borrow
another
gun
go
over
after
midnight
they
see
better
if
they
was
to
wait
till
daytime
yes
and
the
nigger
see
better
too
after
midnight
likely
be
asleep
and
they
can
slip
around
through
the
woods
and
hunt
up
his
camp
fire
all
the
better
for
the
dark
if
got
one
i
think
of
that
the
woman
kept
looking
at
me
pretty
curious
and
i
feel
a
bit
comfortable
pretty
soon
she
says
what
did
you
say
your
name
was
honey
m
mary
williams
somehow
it
seem
to
me
that
i
said
it
was
mary
before
so
i
look
up
seemed
to
me
i
said
it
was
sarah
so
i
felt
sort
of
cornered
and
was
afeared
maybe
i
was
looking
it
too
i
wished
the
woman
would
say
something
more
the
longer
she
set
still
the
uneasier
i
was
but
now
she
says
honey
i
thought
you
said
it
was
sarah
when
you
first
come
in
oh
i
did
sarah
mary
williams
my
first
name
some
calls
me
sarah
some
calls
me
mary
oh
the
way
of
it
i
was
feeling
better
then
but
i
wished
i
was
out
of
there
anyway
i
look
up
yet
well
the
woman
fell
to
talking
about
how
hard
times
was
and
how
poor
they
had
to
live
and
how
the
rats
was
as
free
as
if
they
owned
the
place
and
so
forth
and
so
on
and
then
i
got
easy
again
she
was
right
about
the
rats
see
one
stick
his
nose
out
of
a
hole
in
the
corner
every
little
while
she
said
she
had
to
have
things
handy
to
throw
at
them
when
she
was
alone
or
they
give
her
no
peace
she
showed
me
a
bar
of
lead
twisted
up
into
a
knot
and
said
she
was
a
good
shot
with
it
generly
but
wrenched
her
arm
a
day
or
two
ago
and
know
whether
she
could
throw
true
now
but
she
watched
for
a
chance
and
directly
banged
away
at
a
rat
but
she
missed
him
wide
and
said
ouch
it
hurt
her
arm
so
then
she
told
me
to
try
for
the
next
one
i
wanted
to
be
getting
away
before
the
old
man
got
back
but
of
course
i
let
on
i
got
the
thing
and
the
first
rat
that
showed
his
nose
i
let
drive
and
if
a
stayed
where
he
was
a
been
a
tolerable
sick
rat
she
said
that
was
and
she
reckoned
i
would
hive
the
next
one
she
went
and
got
the
lump
of
lead
and
fetched
it
back
and
brought
along
a
hank
of
yarn
which
she
wanted
me
to
help
her
with
i
held
up
my
two
hands
and
she
put
the
hank
over
them
and
went
on
talking
about
her
and
her
matters
but
she
broke
off
to
say
keep
your
eye
on
the
rats
you
better
have
the
lead
in
your
lap
handy
so
she
dropped
the
lump
into
my
lap
just
at
that
moment
and
i
clapped
my
legs
together
on
it
and
she
went
on
talking
but
only
about
a
minute
then
she
took
off
the
hank
and
looked
me
straight
in
the
face
and
very
pleasant
and
says
come
now
your
real
name
wh
what
mum
your
real
name
is
it
bill
or
tom
or
bob
or
what
is
it
i
reckon
i
shook
like
a
leaf
and
i
know
hardly
what
to
do
but
i
says
please
to
poke
fun
at
a
poor
girl
like
me
mum
if
in
the
way
here
no
you
set
down
and
stay
where
you
are
i
going
to
hurt
you
and
i
going
to
tell
on
you
nuther
you
just
tell
me
your
secret
and
trust
me
keep
it
and
more
help
you
my
old
man
if
you
want
him
to
you
see
a
runaway
all
it
anything
there
no
harm
in
it
been
treated
bad
and
you
made
up
your
mind
to
cut
bless
you
child
i
tell
on
you
tell
me
all
about
it
now
a
good
boy
so
i
said
it
be
no
use
to
try
to
play
it
any
longer
and
i
would
just
make
a
clean
breast
and
tell
her
everything
but
she
go
back
on
her
promise
then
i
told
her
my
father
and
mother
was
dead
and
the
law
had
bound
me
out
to
a
mean
old
farmer
in
the
country
thirty
mile
back
from
the
river
and
he
treated
me
so
bad
i
stand
it
no
longer
he
went
away
to
be
gone
a
couple
of
days
and
so
i
took
my
chance
and
stole
some
of
his
old
clothes
and
cleared
out
and
i
had
been
three
nights
coming
the
thirty
miles
i
traveled
nights
and
hid
daytimes
and
slept
and
the
bag
of
bread
and
meat
i
carried
from
home
lasted
me
all
the
way
and
i
had
i
said
i
believed
my
uncle
abner
moore
would
take
care
of
me
and
so
that
was
why
i
struck
out
for
this
town
of
goshen
goshen
child
this
goshen
this
is
st
petersburg
ten
mile
further
up
the
river
who
told
you
this
was
goshen
why
a
man
i
met
at
daybreak
this
morning
just
as
i
was
going
to
turn
into
the
woods
for
my
regular
sleep
he
told
me
when
the
roads
forked
i
must
take
the
right
hand
and
five
mile
would
fetch
me
to
goshen
he
was
drunk
i
reckon
he
told
you
just
exactly
wrong
well
he
did
act
like
he
was
drunk
but
it
no
matter
now
i
got
to
be
moving
along
fetch
goshen
before
daylight
hold
on
a
minute
put
you
up
a
snack
to
eat
you
might
want
it
so
she
put
me
up
a
snack
and
says
say
when
a
laying
down
which
end
of
her
gets
up
first
answer
up
prompt
now
stop
to
study
over
it
which
end
gets
up
first
the
hind
end
mum
well
then
a
horse
the
end
mum
which
side
of
a
tree
does
the
moss
grow
on
north
side
if
fifteen
cows
is
browsing
on
a
hillside
how
many
of
them
eats
with
their
heads
pointed
the
same
direction
the
whole
fifteen
mum
well
i
reckon
you
have
lived
in
the
country
i
thought
maybe
you
was
trying
to
hocus
me
again
your
real
name
now
george
peters
mum
well
try
to
remember
it
george
forget
and
tell
me
elexander
before
you
go
and
then
get
out
by
saying
george
elexander
when
i
catch
you
and
go
about
women
in
that
old
calico
you
do
a
girl
tolerable
poor
but
you
might
fool
men
maybe
bless
you
child
when
you
set
out
to
thread
a
needle
hold
the
thread
still
and
fetch
the
needle
up
to
it
hold
the
needle
still
and
poke
the
thread
at
it
the
way
a
woman
most
always
does
but
a
man
always
does
way
and
when
you
throw
at
a
rat
or
anything
hitch
yourself
up
a
tiptoe
and
fetch
your
hand
up
over
your
head
as
awkward
as
you
can
and
miss
your
rat
about
six
or
seven
foot
throw
from
the
shoulder
like
there
was
a
pivot
there
for
it
to
turn
on
like
a
girl
not
from
the
wrist
and
elbow
with
your
arm
out
to
one
side
like
a
boy
and
mind
you
when
a
girl
tries
to
catch
anything
in
her
lap
she
throws
her
knees
apart
she
clap
them
together
the
way
you
did
when
you
catched
the
lump
of
lead
why
i
spotted
you
for
a
boy
when
you
was
threading
the
needle
and
i
contrived
the
other
things
just
to
make
certain
now
trot
along
to
your
uncle
sarah
mary
williams
george
elexander
peters
and
if
you
get
into
trouble
you
send
word
to
mrs
judith
loftus
which
is
me
and
do
what
i
can
to
get
you
out
of
it
keep
the
river
road
all
the
way
and
next
time
you
tramp
take
shoes
and
socks
with
you
the
river
a
rocky
one
and
your
be
in
a
condition
when
you
get
to
goshen
i
reckon
i
went
up
the
bank
about
fifty
yards
and
then
i
doubled
on
my
tracks
and
slipped
back
to
where
my
canoe
was
a
good
piece
below
the
house
i
jumped
in
and
was
off
in
a
hurry
i
went
far
enough
to
make
the
head
of
the
island
and
then
started
across
i
took
off
the
for
i
want
no
blinders
on
then
when
i
was
about
the
middle
i
heard
the
clock
begin
to
strike
so
i
stops
and
listens
the
sound
come
faint
over
the
water
but
clear
eleven
when
i
struck
the
head
of
the
island
i
never
waited
to
blow
though
i
was
most
winded
but
i
shoved
right
into
the
timber
where
my
old
camp
used
to
be
and
started
a
good
fire
there
on
a
high
and
dry
spot
then
i
jumped
in
the
canoe
and
dug
out
for
our
place
a
mile
and
a
half
below
as
hard
as
i
could
go
i
landed
and
slopped
through
the
timber
and
up
the
ridge
and
into
the
cavern
there
jim
laid
sound
asleep
on
the
ground
i
roused
him
out
and
says
git
up
and
hump
yourself
jim
there
a
minute
to
lose
after
us
jim
never
asked
no
questions
he
never
said
a
word
but
the
way
he
worked
for
the
next
half
an
hour
showed
about
how
he
was
scared
by
that
time
everything
we
had
in
the
world
was
on
our
raft
and
she
was
ready
to
be
shoved
out
from
the
willow
cove
where
she
was
hid
we
put
out
the
camp
fire
at
the
cavern
the
first
thing
and
show
a
candle
outside
after
that
i
took
the
canoe
out
from
the
shore
a
little
piece
and
took
a
look
but
if
there
was
a
boat
around
i
see
it
for
stars
and
shadows
good
to
see
by
then
we
got
out
the
raft
and
slipped
along
down
in
the
shade
past
the
foot
of
the
island
dead
still
never
saying
a
word
chapter
xii
it
must
a
been
close
on
to
one
when
we
got
below
the
island
at
last
and
the
raft
did
seem
to
go
mighty
slow
if
a
boat
was
to
come
along
we
was
going
to
take
to
the
canoe
and
break
for
the
illinois
shore
and
it
was
well
a
boat
come
for
we
ever
thought
to
put
the
gun
in
the
canoe
or
a
or
anything
to
eat
we
was
in
ruther
too
much
of
a
sweat
to
think
of
so
many
things
it
good
judgment
to
put
everything
on
the
raft
if
the
men
went
to
the
island
i
just
expect
they
found
the
camp
fire
i
built
and
watched
it
all
night
for
jim
to
come
anyways
they
stayed
away
from
us
and
if
my
building
the
fire
never
fooled
them
it
no
fault
of
mine
i
played
it
as
low
down
on
them
as
i
could
when
the
first
streak
of
day
began
to
show
we
tied
up
to
a
towhead
in
a
big
bend
on
the
illinois
side
and
hacked
off
cottonwood
branches
with
the
hatchet
and
covered
up
the
raft
with
them
so
she
looked
like
there
had
been
a
in
the
bank
there
a
is
a
sandbar
that
has
cottonwoods
on
it
as
thick
as
we
had
mountains
on
the
missouri
shore
and
heavy
timber
on
the
illinois
side
and
the
channel
was
down
the
missouri
shore
at
that
place
so
we
afraid
of
anybody
running
across
us
we
laid
there
all
day
and
watched
the
rafts
and
steamboats
spin
down
the
missouri
shore
and
steamboats
fight
the
big
river
in
the
middle
i
told
jim
all
about
the
time
i
had
jabbering
with
that
woman
and
jim
said
she
was
a
smart
one
and
if
she
was
to
start
after
us
herself
she
set
down
and
watch
a
camp
fire
no
sir
fetch
a
dog
well
then
i
said
why
she
tell
her
husband
to
fetch
a
dog
jim
said
he
bet
she
did
think
of
it
by
the
time
the
men
was
ready
to
start
and
he
believed
they
must
a
gone
to
get
a
dog
and
so
they
lost
all
that
time
or
else
we
be
here
on
a
towhead
sixteen
or
seventeen
mile
below
the
village
no
indeedy
we
would
be
in
that
same
old
town
again
so
i
said
i
care
what
was
the
reason
they
get
us
as
long
as
they
when
it
was
beginning
to
come
on
dark
we
poked
our
heads
out
of
the
cottonwood
thicket
and
looked
up
and
down
and
across
nothing
in
sight
so
jim
took
up
some
of
the
top
planks
of
the
raft
and
built
a
snug
wigwam
to
get
under
in
blazing
weather
and
rainy
and
to
keep
the
things
dry
jim
made
a
floor
for
the
wigwam
and
raised
it
a
foot
or
more
above
the
level
of
the
raft
so
now
the
blankets
and
all
the
traps
was
out
of
reach
of
steamboat
waves
right
in
the
middle
of
the
wigwam
we
made
a
layer
of
dirt
about
five
or
six
inches
deep
with
a
frame
around
it
for
to
hold
it
to
its
place
this
was
to
build
a
fire
on
in
sloppy
weather
or
chilly
the
wigwam
would
keep
it
from
being
seen
we
made
an
extra
too
because
one
of
the
others
might
get
broke
on
a
snag
or
something
we
fixed
up
a
short
forked
stick
to
hang
the
old
lantern
on
because
we
must
always
light
the
lantern
whenever
we
see
a
steamboat
coming
to
keep
from
getting
run
over
but
we
have
to
light
it
for
boats
unless
we
see
we
was
in
what
they
call
a
crossing
for
the
river
was
pretty
high
yet
very
low
banks
being
still
a
little
under
water
so
boats
always
run
the
channel
but
hunted
easy
water
this
second
night
we
run
between
seven
and
eight
hours
with
a
current
that
was
making
over
four
mile
an
hour
we
catched
fish
and
talked
and
we
took
a
swim
now
and
then
to
keep
off
sleepiness
it
was
kind
of
solemn
drifting
down
the
big
still
river
laying
on
our
backs
looking
up
at
the
stars
and
we
ever
feel
like
talking
loud
and
it
often
that
we
laughed
only
a
little
kind
of
a
low
chuckle
we
had
mighty
good
weather
as
a
general
thing
and
nothing
ever
happened
to
us
at
all
that
night
nor
the
next
nor
the
next
every
night
we
passed
towns
some
of
them
away
up
on
black
hillsides
nothing
but
just
a
shiny
bed
of
lights
not
a
house
could
you
see
the
fifth
night
we
passed
st
louis
and
it
was
like
the
whole
world
lit
up
in
st
petersburg
they
used
to
say
there
was
twenty
or
thirty
thousand
people
in
st
louis
but
i
never
believed
it
till
i
see
that
wonderful
spread
of
lights
at
two
that
still
night
there
a
sound
there
everybody
was
asleep
every
night
now
i
used
to
slip
ashore
towards
ten
at
some
little
village
and
buy
ten
or
fifteen
worth
of
meal
or
bacon
or
other
stuff
to
eat
and
sometimes
i
lifted
a
chicken
that
roosting
comfortable
and
took
him
along
pap
always
said
take
a
chicken
when
you
get
a
chance
because
if
you
want
him
yourself
you
can
easy
find
somebody
that
does
and
a
good
deed
ever
forgot
i
never
see
pap
when
he
want
the
chicken
himself
but
that
is
what
he
used
to
say
anyway
mornings
before
daylight
i
slipped
into
cornfields
and
borrowed
a
watermelon
or
a
mushmelon
or
a
punkin
or
some
new
corn
or
things
of
that
kind
pap
always
said
it
no
harm
to
borrow
things
if
you
was
meaning
to
pay
them
back
some
time
but
the
widow
said
it
anything
but
a
soft
name
for
stealing
and
no
decent
body
would
do
it
jim
said
he
reckoned
the
widow
was
partly
right
and
pap
was
partly
right
so
the
best
way
would
be
for
us
to
pick
out
two
or
three
things
from
the
list
and
say
we
borrow
them
any
more
then
he
reckoned
it
be
no
harm
to
borrow
the
others
so
we
talked
it
over
all
one
night
drifting
along
down
the
river
trying
to
make
up
our
minds
whether
to
drop
the
watermelons
or
the
cantelopes
or
the
mushmelons
or
what
but
towards
daylight
we
got
it
all
settled
satisfactory
and
concluded
to
drop
crabapples
and
we
feeling
just
right
before
that
but
it
was
all
comfortable
now
i
was
glad
the
way
it
come
out
too
because
crabapples
ever
good
and
the
be
ripe
for
two
or
three
months
yet
we
shot
a
now
and
then
that
got
up
too
early
in
the
morning
or
go
to
bed
early
enough
in
the
evening
take
it
all
round
we
lived
pretty
high
the
fifth
night
below
st
louis
we
had
a
big
storm
after
midnight
with
a
power
of
thunder
and
lightning
and
the
rain
poured
down
in
a
solid
sheet
we
stayed
in
the
wigwam
and
let
the
raft
take
care
of
itself
when
the
lightning
glared
out
we
could
see
a
big
straight
river
ahead
and
high
rocky
bluffs
on
both
sides
by
and
by
says
i
jim
looky
yonder
it
was
a
steamboat
that
had
killed
herself
on
a
rock
we
was
drifting
straight
down
for
her
the
lightning
showed
her
very
distinct
she
was
leaning
over
with
part
of
her
upper
deck
above
water
and
you
could
see
every
little
clean
and
clear
and
a
chair
by
the
big
bell
with
an
old
slouch
hat
hanging
on
the
back
of
it
when
the
flashes
come
well
it
being
away
in
the
night
and
stormy
and
all
so
i
felt
just
the
way
any
other
boy
would
a
felt
when
i
see
that
wreck
laying
there
so
mournful
and
lonesome
in
the
middle
of
the
river
i
wanted
to
get
aboard
of
her
and
slink
around
a
little
and
see
what
there
was
there
so
i
says
land
on
her
jim
but
jim
was
dead
against
it
at
first
he
says
i
want
to
go
er
no
wrack
well
en
we
better
let
well
alone
as
de
good
book
says
like
as
not
a
watchman
on
dat
wrack
watchman
your
grandmother
i
says
there
nothing
to
watch
but
the
texas
and
the
and
do
you
reckon
going
to
resk
his
life
for
a
texas
and
a
such
a
night
as
this
when
likely
to
break
up
and
wash
off
down
the
river
any
minute
jim
say
nothing
to
that
so
he
try
and
besides
i
says
we
might
borrow
something
worth
having
out
of
the
stateroom
seegars
i
bet
you
and
cost
five
cents
apiece
solid
cash
steamboat
captains
is
always
rich
and
get
sixty
dollars
a
month
and
they
care
a
cent
what
a
thing
costs
you
know
long
as
they
want
it
stick
a
candle
in
your
pocket
i
rest
jim
till
we
give
her
a
rummaging
do
you
reckon
tom
sawyer
would
ever
go
by
this
thing
not
for
pie
he
call
it
an
adventure
what
call
it
and
land
on
that
wreck
if
it
was
his
last
act
and
he
throw
style
into
it
he
spread
himself
nor
nothing
why
think
it
was
christopher
discovering
i
wish
tom
sawyer
was
here
jim
he
grumbled
a
little
but
give
in
he
said
we
talk
any
more
than
we
could
help
and
then
talk
mighty
low
the
lightning
showed
us
the
wreck
again
just
in
time
and
we
fetched
the
stabboard
derrick
and
made
fast
there
the
deck
was
high
out
here
we
went
sneaking
down
the
slope
of
it
to
labboard
in
the
dark
towards
the
texas
feeling
our
way
slow
with
our
feet
and
spreading
our
hands
out
to
fend
off
the
guys
for
it
was
so
dark
we
see
no
sign
of
them
pretty
soon
we
struck
the
forward
end
of
the
skylight
and
clumb
on
to
it
and
the
next
step
fetched
us
in
front
of
the
door
which
was
open
and
by
jimminy
away
down
through
the
we
see
a
light
and
all
in
the
same
second
we
seem
to
hear
low
voices
in
yonder
jim
whispered
and
said
he
was
feeling
powerful
sick
and
told
me
to
come
along
i
says
all
right
and
was
going
to
start
for
the
raft
but
just
then
i
heard
a
voice
wail
out
and
say
oh
please
boys
i
swear
i
ever
tell
another
voice
said
pretty
loud
a
lie
jim
turner
acted
this
way
before
you
always
want
your
share
of
the
truck
and
always
got
it
too
because
swore
if
you
tell
but
this
time
said
it
jest
one
time
too
many
the
meanest
treacherousest
hound
in
this
country
by
this
time
jim
was
gone
for
the
raft
i
was
just
with
curiosity
and
i
says
to
myself
tom
sawyer
back
out
now
and
so
i
either
to
see
going
on
here
so
i
dropped
on
my
hands
and
knees
in
the
little
passage
and
crept
aft
in
the
dark
till
there
but
one
stateroom
betwixt
me
and
the
of
the
texas
then
in
there
i
see
a
man
stretched
on
the
floor
and
tied
hand
and
foot
and
two
men
standing
over
him
and
one
of
them
had
a
dim
lantern
in
his
hand
and
the
other
one
had
a
pistol
this
one
kept
pointing
the
pistol
at
the
head
on
the
floor
and
saying
like
to
and
i
orter
too
a
mean
skunk
the
man
on
the
floor
would
shrivel
up
and
say
oh
please
bill
i
ever
to
tell
and
every
time
he
said
that
the
man
with
the
lantern
would
laugh
and
say
you
you
never
said
no
truer
thing
that
you
bet
you
and
once
he
said
hear
him
beg
and
yit
if
we
got
the
best
of
him
and
tied
him
a
killed
us
both
and
what
for
jist
for
jist
because
we
stood
on
our
rights
what
for
but
i
lay
you
to
threaten
nobody
any
more
jim
turner
put
up
that
pistol
bill
bill
says
i
want
to
jake
packard
for
him
and
he
kill
old
hatfield
jist
the
same
way
and
he
deserve
it
but
i
want
him
killed
and
got
my
reasons
for
it
bless
heart
for
them
words
jake
packard
never
forgit
you
i
live
says
the
man
on
the
floor
sort
of
blubbering
packard
take
no
notice
of
that
but
hung
up
his
lantern
on
a
nail
and
started
towards
where
i
was
there
in
the
dark
and
motioned
bill
to
come
i
crawfished
as
fast
as
i
could
about
two
yards
but
the
boat
slanted
so
that
i
make
very
good
time
so
to
keep
from
getting
run
over
and
catched
i
crawled
into
a
stateroom
on
the
upper
side
the
man
came
along
in
the
dark
and
when
packard
got
to
my
stateroom
he
says
here
come
in
here
and
in
he
come
and
bill
after
him
but
before
they
got
in
i
was
up
in
the
upper
berth
cornered
and
sorry
i
come
then
they
stood
there
with
their
hands
on
the
ledge
of
the
berth
and
talked
i
see
them
but
i
could
tell
where
they
was
by
the
whisky
been
having
i
was
glad
i
drink
whisky
but
it
made
much
difference
anyway
because
most
of
the
time
they
a
treed
me
because
i
breathe
i
was
too
scared
and
besides
a
body
breathe
and
hear
such
talk
they
talked
low
and
earnest
bill
wanted
to
kill
turner
he
says
said
tell
and
he
will
if
we
was
to
give
both
our
shares
to
him
now
it
make
no
difference
after
the
row
and
the
way
served
him
born
turn
evidence
now
you
hear
me
for
putting
him
out
of
his
troubles
i
says
packard
very
quiet
blame
it
sorter
begun
to
think
you
well
then
all
right
go
and
do
it
hold
on
a
minute
i
had
my
say
yit
you
listen
to
me
good
but
quieter
ways
if
the
got
to
be
done
but
what
i
say
is
this
it
good
sense
to
go
around
after
a
halter
if
you
can
git
at
what
up
to
in
some
way
jist
as
good
and
at
the
same
time
bring
you
into
no
resks
that
so
you
bet
it
is
but
how
you
to
manage
it
this
time
well
my
idea
is
this
rustle
around
and
gather
up
whatever
pickins
overlooked
in
the
staterooms
and
shove
for
shore
and
hide
the
truck
then
wait
now
i
say
it
to
be
two
hours
this
wrack
breaks
up
and
washes
off
down
the
river
see
be
drownded
and
have
nobody
to
blame
for
it
but
his
own
self
i
reckon
a
considerble
sight
better
of
him
unfavorable
to
a
man
as
long
as
you
can
git
it
it
good
sense
it
good
morals
i
right
yes
i
you
are
but
she
break
up
and
wash
off
well
we
can
wait
the
two
hours
anyway
and
see
we
all
right
then
come
along
so
they
started
and
i
lit
out
all
in
a
cold
sweat
and
scrambled
forward
it
was
dark
as
pitch
there
but
i
said
in
a
kind
of
a
coarse
whisper
jim
and
he
answered
up
right
at
my
elbow
with
a
sort
of
a
moan
and
i
says
quick
jim
it
no
time
for
fooling
around
and
moaning
a
gang
of
murderers
in
yonder
and
if
we
hunt
up
their
boat
and
set
her
drifting
down
the
river
so
these
fellows
get
away
from
the
wreck
one
of
going
to
be
in
a
bad
fix
but
if
we
find
their
boat
we
can
put
all
of
in
a
bad
fix
for
the
sheriff
get
quick
hurry
hunt
the
labboard
side
you
hunt
the
stabboard
you
start
at
the
raft
and
oh
my
lordy
lordy
dey
no
no
she
done
broke
loose
en
gone
i
en
here
we
is
chapter
xiii
well
i
catched
my
breath
and
most
fainted
shut
up
on
a
wreck
with
such
a
gang
as
that
but
it
no
time
to
be
sentimentering
got
to
find
that
boat
now
had
to
have
it
for
ourselves
so
we
went
and
shaking
down
the
stabboard
side
and
slow
work
it
was
too
seemed
a
week
before
we
got
to
the
stern
no
sign
of
a
boat
jim
said
he
believe
he
could
go
any
further
so
scared
he
hardly
any
strength
left
he
said
but
i
said
come
on
if
we
get
left
on
this
wreck
we
are
in
a
fix
sure
so
on
we
prowled
again
we
struck
for
the
stern
of
the
texas
and
found
it
and
then
scrabbled
along
forwards
on
the
skylight
hanging
on
from
shutter
to
shutter
for
the
edge
of
the
skylight
was
in
the
water
when
we
got
pretty
close
to
the
door
there
was
the
skiff
sure
enough
i
could
just
barely
see
her
i
felt
ever
so
thankful
in
another
second
i
would
a
been
aboard
of
her
but
just
then
the
door
opened
one
of
the
men
stuck
his
head
out
only
about
a
couple
of
foot
from
me
and
i
thought
i
was
gone
but
he
jerked
it
in
again
and
says
heave
that
blame
lantern
out
sight
bill
he
flung
a
bag
of
something
into
the
boat
and
then
got
in
himself
and
set
down
it
was
packard
then
bill
he
come
out
and
got
in
packard
says
in
a
low
voice
all
ready
shove
off
i
hardly
hang
on
to
the
shutters
i
was
so
weak
but
bill
says
hold
on
you
go
through
him
no
you
no
so
got
his
share
the
cash
yet
well
then
come
along
no
use
to
take
truck
and
leave
money
say
he
suspicion
what
up
to
maybe
he
but
we
got
to
have
it
anyway
come
along
so
they
got
out
and
went
in
the
door
slammed
to
because
it
was
on
the
careened
side
and
in
a
half
second
i
was
in
the
boat
and
jim
come
tumbling
after
me
i
out
with
my
knife
and
cut
the
rope
and
away
we
went
we
touch
an
oar
and
we
speak
nor
whisper
nor
hardly
even
breathe
we
went
gliding
swift
along
dead
silent
past
the
tip
of
the
and
past
the
stern
then
in
a
second
or
two
more
we
was
a
hundred
yards
below
the
wreck
and
the
darkness
soaked
her
up
every
last
sign
of
her
and
we
was
safe
and
knowed
it
when
we
was
three
or
four
hundred
yards
we
see
the
lantern
show
like
a
little
spark
at
the
texas
door
for
a
second
and
we
knowed
by
that
that
the
rascals
had
missed
their
boat
and
was
beginning
to
understand
that
they
was
in
just
as
much
trouble
now
as
jim
turner
was
then
jim
manned
the
oars
and
we
took
out
after
our
raft
now
was
the
first
time
that
i
begun
to
worry
about
the
men
i
reckon
i
had
time
to
before
i
begun
to
think
how
dreadful
it
was
even
for
murderers
to
be
in
such
a
fix
i
says
to
myself
there
no
telling
but
i
might
come
to
be
a
murderer
myself
yet
and
then
how
would
i
like
it
so
says
i
to
jim
the
first
light
we
see
land
a
hundred
yards
below
it
or
above
it
in
a
place
where
a
good
for
you
and
the
skiff
and
then
go
and
fix
up
some
kind
of
a
yarn
and
get
somebody
to
go
for
that
gang
and
get
them
out
of
their
scrape
so
they
can
be
hung
when
their
time
comes
but
that
idea
was
a
failure
for
pretty
soon
it
begun
to
storm
again
and
this
time
worse
than
ever
the
rain
poured
down
and
never
a
light
showed
everybody
in
bed
i
reckon
we
boomed
along
down
the
river
watching
for
lights
and
watching
for
our
raft
after
a
long
time
the
rain
let
up
but
the
clouds
stayed
and
the
lightning
kept
whimpering
and
by
and
by
a
flash
showed
us
a
black
thing
ahead
floating
and
we
made
for
it
it
was
the
raft
and
mighty
glad
was
we
to
get
aboard
of
it
again
we
seen
a
light
now
away
down
to
the
right
on
shore
so
i
said
i
would
go
for
it
the
skiff
was
half
full
of
plunder
which
that
gang
had
stole
there
on
the
wreck
we
hustled
it
on
to
the
raft
in
a
pile
and
i
told
jim
to
float
along
down
and
show
a
light
when
he
judged
he
had
gone
about
two
mile
and
keep
it
burning
till
i
come
then
i
manned
my
oars
and
shoved
for
the
light
as
i
got
down
towards
it
three
or
four
more
showed
up
on
a
hillside
it
was
a
village
i
closed
in
above
the
shore
light
and
laid
on
my
oars
and
floated
as
i
went
by
i
see
it
was
a
lantern
hanging
on
the
jackstaff
of
a
ferryboat
i
skimmed
around
for
the
watchman
whereabouts
he
slept
and
by
and
by
i
found
him
roosting
on
the
bitts
forward
with
his
head
down
between
his
knees
i
gave
his
shoulder
two
or
three
little
shoves
and
begun
to
cry
he
stirred
up
in
a
kind
of
a
startlish
way
but
when

up

to
the

just
in

in
the
to
stay
all
night
at
her
house
miss
i
disremember
her
name
and
they
lost
their
and
swung
around
and
went
down
stern
first
about
two
mile
and
on
the
wreck
and
the
ferryman
and
the
nigger
woman
and
the
horses
was
all
lost
but
miss
hooker
she
made
a
grab
and
got
aboard
the
wreck
well
about
an
hour
after
dark
we
come
along
down
in
our
and
it
was
so
dark
we
notice
the
wreck
till
we
was
right
on
it
and
so
we
but
all
of
us
was
saved
but
bill
whipple
and
oh
he
was
the
best
cretur
i
most
wish
it
had
been
me
i
do
my
george
the
beatenest
thing
i
ever
struck
and
then
what
did
you
all
do
well
we
hollered
and
took
on
but
so
wide
there
we
make
nobody
hear
so
pap
said
somebody
got
to
get
ashore
and
get
help
somehow
i
was
the
only
one
that
could
swim
so
i
made
a
dash
for
it
and
miss
hooker
she
said
if
i
strike
help
sooner
come
here
and
hunt
up
her
uncle
and
fix
the
thing
i
made
the
land
about
a
mile
below
and
been
fooling
along
ever
since
trying
to
get
people
to
do
something
but
they
said
in
such
a
night
and
such
a
current
there
no
sense
in
it
go
for
the
steam
ferry
now
if
go
and
by
jackson
like
to
and
blame
it
i
know
but
i
will
but
who
in
the
to
pay
for
it
do
you
reckon
your
pap
why
all
right
miss
hooker
she
tole
me
particular
that
her
uncle
hornback
great
guns
is
he
her
uncle
looky
here
you
break
for
that
light
over
and
turn
out
west
when
you
git
there
and
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
out
come
to
the
tavern
tell
to
dart
you
out
to
jim
and
foot
the
bill
and
you
fool
around
any
because
want
to
know
the
news
tell
him
have
his
niece
all
safe
before
he
can
get
to
town
hump
yourself
now
up
around
the
corner
here
to
roust
out
my
engineer
i
struck
for
the
light
but
as
soon
as
he
turned
the
corner
i
went
back
and
got
into
my
skiff
and
bailed
her
out
and
then
pulled
up
shore
in
the
easy
water
about
six
hundred
yards
and
tucked
myself
in
among
some
woodboats
for
i
rest
easy
till
i
could
see
the
ferryboat
start
but
take
it
all
around
i
was
feeling
ruther
comfortable
on
accounts
of
taking
all
this
trouble
for
that
gang
for
not
many
would
a
done
it
i
wished
the
widow
knowed
about
it
i
judged
she
would
be
proud
of
me
for
helping
these
rapscallions
because
rapscallions
and
dead
beats
is
the
kind
the
widow
and
good
people
takes
the
most
interest
in
well
before
long
here
comes
the
wreck
dim
and
dusky
sliding
along
down
a
kind
of
cold
shiver
went
through
me
and
then
i
struck
out
for
her
she
was
very
deep
and
i
see
in
a
minute
there
much
chance
for
anybody
being
alive
in
her
i
pulled
all
around
her
and
hollered
a
little
but
there
any
answer
all
dead
still
i
felt
a
little
bit
about
the
gang
but
not
much
for
i
reckoned
if
they
could
stand
it
i
could
then
here
comes
the
ferryboat
so
i
shoved
for
the
middle
of
the
river
on
a
long
slant
and
when
i
judged
i
was
out
of
i
laid
on
my
oars
and
looked
back
and
see
her
go
and
smell
around
the
wreck
for
miss
remainders
because
the
captain
would
know
her
uncle
hornback
would
want
them
and
then
pretty
soon
the
ferryboat
give
it
up
and
went
for
the
shore
and
i
laid
into
my
work
and
went
down
the
river
it
did
seem
a
powerful
long
time
before
light
showed
up
and
when
it
did
show
it
looked
like
it
was
a
thousand
mile
off
by
the
time
i
got
there
the
sky
was
beginning
to
get
a
little
gray
in
the
east
so
we
struck
for
an
island
and
hid
the
raft
and
sunk
the
skiff
and
turned
in
and
slept
like
dead
people
chapter
xiv
by
and
by
when
we
got
up
we
turned
over
the
truck
the
gang
had
stole
off
of
the
wreck
and
found
boots
and
blankets
and
clothes
and
all
sorts
of
other
things
and
a
lot
of
books
and
a
spyglass
and
three
boxes
of
seegars
we
ever
been
this
rich
before
in
neither
of
our
lives
the
seegars
was
prime
we
laid
off
all
the
afternoon
in
the
woods
talking
and
me
reading
the
books
and
having
a
general
good
time
i
told
jim
all
about
what
happened
inside
the
wreck
and
at
the
ferryboat
and
i
said
these
kinds
of
things
was
adventures
but
he
said
he
want
no
more
adventures
he
said
that
when
i
went
in
the
texas
and
he
crawled
back
to
get
on
the
raft
and
found
her
gone
he
nearly
died
because
he
judged
it
was
all
up
with
him
anyway
it
could
be
fixed
for
if
he
get
saved
he
would
get
drownded
and
if
he
did
get
saved
whoever
saved
him
would
send
him
back
home
so
as
to
get
the
reward
and
then
miss
watson
would
sell
him
south
sure
well
he
was
right
he
was
most
always
right
he
had
an
uncommon
level
head
for
a
nigger
i
read
considerable
to
jim
about
kings
and
dukes
and
earls
and
such
and
how
gaudy
they
dressed
and
how
much
style
they
put
on
and
called
each
other
your
majesty
and
your
grace
and
your
lordship
and
so
on
of
mister
and
eyes
bugged
out

interested

what
we
was
after
we
would
sell
the
raft
and
get
on
a
steamboat
and
go
way
up
the
ohio
amongst
the
free
states
and
then
be
out
of
trouble
well
the
second
night
a
fog
begun
to
come
on
and
we
made
for
a
towhead
to
tie
to
for
it
do
to
try
to
run
in
a
fog
but
when
i
paddled
ahead
in
the
canoe
with
the
line
to
make
fast
there
anything
but
little
saplings
to
tie
to
i
passed
the
line
around
one
of
them
right
on
the
edge
of
the
cut
bank
but
there
was
a
stiff
current
and
the
raft
come
booming
down
so
lively
she
tore
it
out
by
the
roots
and
away
she
went
i
see
the
fog
closing
down
and
it
made
me
so
sick
and
scared
i
budge
for
most
a
half
a
minute
it
seemed
to
me
and
then
there
no
raft
in
sight
you
see
twenty
yards
i
jumped
into
the
canoe
and
run
back
to
the
stern
and
grabbed
the
paddle
and
set
her
back
a
stroke
but
she
come
i
was
in
such
a
hurry
i
untied
her
i
got
up
and
tried
to
untie
her
but
i
was
so
excited
my
hands
shook
so
i
hardly
do
anything
with
them
as
soon
as
i
got
started
i
took
out
after
the
raft
hot
and
heavy
right
down
the
towhead
that
was
all
right
as
far
as
it
went
but
the
towhead
sixty
yards
long
and
the
minute
i
flew
by
the
foot
of
it
i
shot
out
into
the
solid
white
fog
and
no
more
idea
which
way
i
was
going
than
a
dead
man
thinks
i
it
do
to
paddle
first
i
know
run
into
the
bank
or
a
towhead
or
something
i
got
to
set
still
and
float
and
yet
mighty
fidgety
business
to
have
to
hold
your
hands
still
at
such
a
time
i
whooped
and
listened
away
down
there
somewheres
i
hears
a
small
whoop
and
up
comes
my
spirits
i
went
tearing
after
it
listening
sharp
to
hear
it
again
the
next
time
it
come
i
see
i
heading
for
it
but
heading
away
to
the
right
of
it
and
the
next
time
i
was
heading
away
to
the
left
of
it
and
not
gaining
on
it
much
either
for
i
was
flying
around
this
way
and
that
and
but
it
was
going
straight
ahead
all
the
time
i
did
wish
the
fool
would
think
to
beat
a
tin
pan
and
beat
it
all
the
time
but
he
never
did
and
it
was
the
still
places
between
the
whoops
that
was
making
the
trouble
for
me
well
i
fought
along
and
directly
i
hears
the
whoop
behind
me
i
was
tangled
good
now
that
was
somebody
whoop
or
else
i
was
turned
around
i
throwed
the
paddle
down
i
heard
the
whoop
again
it
was
behind
me
yet
but
in
a
different
place
it
kept
coming
and
kept
changing
its
place
and
i
kept
answering
till
by
and
by
it
was
in
front
of
me
again
and
i
knowed
the
current
had
swung
the
head
and
i
was
all
right
if
that
was
jim
and
not
some
other
raftsman
hollering
i
tell
nothing
about
voices
in
a
fog
for
nothing
look
natural
nor
sound
natural
in
a
fog
the
whooping
went
on
and
in
about
a
minute
i
come
down
on
a
cut
bank
with
smoky
ghosts
of
big
trees
on
it
and
the
current
throwed
me
off
to
the
left
and
shot
by
amongst
a
lot
of
snags
that
fairly
roared
the
currrent
was
tearing
by
them
so
swift
in
another
second
or
two
it
was
solid
white
and
still
again
i
set
perfectly
still
then
listening
to
my
heart
thump
and
i
reckon
i
draw
a
breath
while
it
thumped
a
hundred
i
just
give
up
then
i
knowed
what
the
matter
was
that
cut
bank
was
an
island
and
jim
had
gone
down
side
of
it
it
no
towhead
that
you
could
float
by
in
ten
minutes
it
had
the
big
timber
of
a
regular
island
it
might
be
five
or
six
miles
long
and
more
than
half
a
mile
wide
i
kept
quiet
with
my
ears
cocked
about
fifteen
minutes
i
reckon
i
was
floating
along
of
course
four
or
five
miles
an
hour
but
you
ever
think
of
that
no
you
feel
like
you
are
laying
dead
still
on
the
water
and
if
a
little
glimpse
of
a
snag
slips
by
you
think
to
yourself
how
fast
going
but
you
catch
your
breath
and
think
my
how
that
tearing
along
if
you
think
it
dismal
and
lonesome
out
in
a
fog
that
way
by
yourself
in
the
night
you
try
it
once
see
next
for
about
a
half
an
hour
i
whoops
now
and
then
at
last
i
hears
the
answer
a
long
ways
off
and
tries
to
follow
it
but
i
do
it
and
directly
i
judged
got
into
a
nest
of
towheads
for
i
had
little
dim
glimpses
of
them
on
both
sides
of
me
sometimes
just
a
narrow
channel
between
and
some
that
i
see
i
knowed
was
there
because
hear
the
wash
of
the
current
against
the
old
dead
brush
and
trash
that
hung
over
the
banks
well
i
long
loosing
the
whoops
down
amongst
the
towheads
and
i
only
tried
to
chase
them
a
little
while
anyway
because
it
was
worse
than
chasing
a
you
never
knowed
a
sound
dodge
around
so
and
swap
places
so
quick
and
so
much
i
had
to
claw
away
from
the
bank
pretty
lively
four
or
five
times
to
keep
from
knocking
the
islands
out
of
the
river
and
so
i
judged
the
raft
must
be
butting
into
the
bank
every
now
and
then
or
else
it
would
get
further
ahead
and
clear
out
of
hearing
it
was
floating
a
little
faster
than
what
i
was
well
i
seemed
to
be
in
the
open
river
again
by
and
by
but
i
hear
no
sign
of
a
whoop
nowheres
i
reckoned
jim
had
fetched
up
on
a
snag
maybe
and
it
was
all
up
with
him
i
was
good
and
tired
so
i
laid
down
in
the
canoe
and
said
i
bother
no
more
i
want
to
go
to
sleep
of
course
but
i
was
so
sleepy
i
help
it
so
i
thought
i
would
take
jest
one
little
but
i
reckon
it
was
more
than
a
for
when
i
waked
up
the
stars
was
shining
bright
the
fog
was
all
gone
and
i
was
spinning
down
a
big
bend
stern
first
first
i
know
where
i
was
i
thought
i
was
dreaming
and
when
things
began
to
come
back
to
me
they
seemed
to
come
up
dim
out
of
last
week
it
was
a
monstrous
big
river
here
with
the
tallest
and
the
thickest
kind
of
timber
on
both
banks
just
a
solid
wall
as
well
as
i
could
see
by
the
stars
i
looked
away
and
seen
a
black
speck
on
the
water
i
took
after
it
but
when
i
got
to
it
it
nothing
but
a
couple
of
sawlogs
made
fast
together
then
i
see
another
speck
and
chased
that
then
another
and
this
time
i
was
right
it
was
the
raft
when
i
got
to
it
jim
was
setting
there
with
his
head
down
between
his
knees
asleep
with
his
right
arm
hanging
over
the
the
other
oar
was
smashed
off
and
the
raft
was
littered
up
with
leaves
and
branches
and
dirt
so
had
a
rough
time
i
made
fast
and
laid
down
under
nose
on
the
raft
and
began
to
gap
and
stretch
my
fists
out
against
jim
and
says

is
there
nothing
in
it
i
know
because
been
here
all
the
time
jim

minutes
but
set

studying

then
he
says
well

i
i

my

powerfullest
dream
i

en
i
ever

no
dream
tired
me
like
dis
one
oh
well
all
right
because
a
dream
does
tire
a
body
like
everything
sometimes
but
this
one
was
a
staving
dream
tell
me
all
about
it
jim
so
jim
went
to
work
and
told
me
the
whole
thing
right
through
just
as
it
happened
only
he
painted
it
up
considerable
then
he
said
he
must
start
in
and
it
because
it
was
sent
for
a
warning
he
said
the
first
towhead
stood
for
a
man
that
would
try
to
do
us
some
good
but
the
current
was
another
man
that
would
get
us
away
from
him
the
whoops
was
warnings
that
would
come
to
us
every
now
and
then
and
if
we
try
hard
to
make
out
to
understand
them
just
take
us
into
bad
luck
of
keeping
us
out
of
it
the
lot
of
towheads
was
troubles
we
was
going
to
get
into
with
quarrelsome
people
and
all
kinds
of
mean
folks
but
if
we
minded
our
business
and
talk
back
and
aggravate
them
we
would
pull
through
and
get
out
of
the
fog
and
into
the
big
clear
river
which
was
the
free
states
and
have
no
more
trouble
it
had
clouded
up
pretty
dark
just
after
i
got
on
to
the
raft
but
it
was
clearing
up
again
now
oh
well
all
interpreted
well
enough
as
far
as
it
goes
jim
i
says
but
what
does
these
things
stand
for
it
was
the
leaves
and
rubbish
on
the
raft
and
the
smashed
oar
you
could
see
them
now
jim
looked
at
the
trash
and
then
looked
at
me
and
back
at
the
trash
again
he
had
got
the
dream
fixed
so
strong
in
his
head
that
he
seem
to
shake
it
loose
and
get
the
facts
back
into
its
place
again
right
away
but
when
he
did
get
the
thing
straightened
around
he
looked
at
me
steady
without
ever
smiling
and
says
what
do
dey
for
gwyne
to
tell
you
when
i
got
all
wore
out
wid
work
en
wid
de
for

en
went
to
sleep
my
heart
wuz

en
when
i
wake

truck
dah
is
trash
en
trash
is
what
people
is
dat
puts
dirt
on
de
head
er
dey
en
makes

then
he
got
up
slow
and
walked
to
the
wigwam
and
went
in
there
without
saying
anything
but
that
but
that
was
enough
it
made
me
feel
so
mean
i
could
almost
kissed
his
foot
to
get
him
to
take
it
back
it
was
fifteen
minutes
before
i
could
work
myself
up
to
go
and
humble
myself
to
a
nigger
but
i
done
it
and
i
ever
sorry
for
it
afterwards
neither
i
do
him
no
more
mean
tricks
and
i
done
that
one
if
a
knowed
it
would
make
him
feel
that
way
chapter
xvi
we
slept
most
all
day
and
started
out
at
night
a
little
ways
behind
a
monstrous
long
raft
that
was
as
long
going
by
as
a
procession
she
had
four
long
sweeps
at
each
end
so
we
judged
she
carried
as
many
as
thirty
men
likely
she
had
five
big
wigwams
aboard
wide
apart
and
an
open
camp
fire
in
the
middle
and
a
tall
at
each
end
there
was
a
power
of
style
about
her
it
amounted
to
something
being
a
raftsman
on
such
a
craft
as
that
we
went
drifting
down
into
a
big
bend
and
the
night
clouded
up
and
got
hot
the
river
was
very
wide
and
was
walled
with
solid
timber
on
both
sides
you
see
a
break
in
it
hardly
ever
or
a
light
we
talked
about
cairo
and
wondered
whether
we
would
know
it
when
we
got
to
it
i
said
likely
we
because
i
had
heard
say
there
but
about
a
dozen
houses
there
and
if
they
happen
to
have
them
lit
up
how
was
we
going
to
know
we
was
passing
a
town
jim
said
if
the
two
big
rivers
joined
together
there
that
would
show
but
i
said
maybe
we
might
think
we
was
passing
the
foot
of
an
island
and
coming
into
the
same
old
river
again
that
disturbed
jim
and
me
too
so
the
question
was
what
to
do
i
said
paddle
ashore
the
first
time
a
light
showed
and
tell
them
pap
was
behind
coming
along
with
a
and
was
a
green
hand
at
the
business
and
wanted
to
know
how
far
it
was
to
cairo
jim
thought
it
was
a
good
idea
so
we
took
a
smoke
on
it
and
waited
there
nothing
to
do
now
but
to
look
out
sharp
for
the
town
and
not
pass
it
without
seeing
it
he
said
be
mighty
sure
to
see
it
because
be
a
free
man
the
minute
he
seen
it
but
if
he
missed
it
be
in
a
slave
country
again
and
no
more
show
for
freedom
every
little
while
he
jumps
up
and
says
dah
she
is
but
it
it
was
or
lightning
bugs
so
he
set
down
again
and
went
to
watching
same
as
before
jim
said
it
made
him
all
over
trembly
and
feverish
to
be
so
close
to
freedom
well
i
can
tell
you
it
made
me
all
over
trembly
and
feverish
too
to
hear
him
because
i
begun
to
get
it
through
my
head
that
he
was
most
free
and
who
was
to
blame
for
it
why
me
i
get
that
out
of
my
conscience
no
how
nor
no
way
it
got
to
troubling
me
so
i
rest
i
stay
still
in
one
place
it
ever
come
home
to
me
before
what
this
thing
was
that
i
was
doing
but
now
it
did
and
it
stayed
with
me
and
scorched
me
more
and
more
i
tried
to
make
out
to
myself
that
i
to
blame
because
i
run
jim
off
from
his
rightful
owner
but
it
no
use
conscience
up
and
says
every
time
but
you
knowed
he
was
running
for
his
freedom
and
you
could
a
paddled
ashore
and
told
somebody
that
was
so
i
get
around
that
noway
that
was
where
it
pinched
conscience
says
to
me
what
had
poor
miss
watson
done
to
you
that
you
could
see
her
nigger
go
off
right
under
your
eyes
and
never
say
one
single
word
what
did
that
poor
old
woman
do
to
you
that
you
could
treat
her
so
mean
why
she
tried
to
learn
you
your
book
she
tried
to
learn
you
your
manners
she
tried
to
be
good
to
you
every
way
she
knowed
how
what
she
done
i
got
to
feeling
so
mean
and
so
miserable
i
most
wished
i
was
dead
i
fidgeted
up
and
down
the
raft
abusing
myself
to
myself
and
jim
was
fidgeting
up
and
down
past
me
we
neither
of
us
could
keep
still
every
time
he
danced
around
and
says
cairo
it
went
through
me
like
a
shot
and
i
thought
if
it
was
cairo
i
reckoned
i
would
die
of
miserableness
jim
talked
out
loud
all
the
time
while
i
was
talking
to
myself
he
was
saying
how
the
first
thing
he
would
do
when
he
got
to
a
free
state
he
would
go
to
saving
up
money
and
never
spend
a
single
cent
and
when
he
got
enough
he
would
buy
his
wife
which
was
owned
on
a
farm
close
to
where
miss
watson
lived
and
then
they
would
both
work
to
buy
the
two
children
and
if
their
master
sell
them
get
an
to
go
and
steal
them
it
most
froze
me
to
hear
such
talk
he
ever
dared
to
talk
such
talk
in
his
life
before
just
see
what
a
difference
it
made
in
him
the
minute
he
judged
he
was
about
free
it
was
according
to
the
old
saying
give
a
nigger
an
inch
and
take
an
ell
thinks
i
this
is
what
comes
of
my
not
thinking
here
was
this
nigger
which
i
had
as
good
as
helped
to
run
away
coming
right
out
and
saying
he
would
steal
his
children
children
that
belonged
to
a
man
i
even
know
a
man
that
ever
done
me
no
harm
i
was
sorry
to
hear
jim
say
that
it
was
such
a
lowering
of
him
my
conscience
got
to
stirring
me
up
hotter
than
ever
until
at
last
i
says
to
it
let
up
on
me
it
too
late
yet
paddle
ashore
at
the
first
light
and
tell
i
felt
easy
and
happy
and
light
as
a
feather
right
off
all
my
troubles

gone
i
went
to

miles
between

sir
says
i
i
let
no
runaway
niggers
get
by
me
if
i
can
help
it
they
went
off
and
i
got
aboard
the
raft
feeling
bad
and
low
because
i
knowed
very
well
i
had
done
wrong
and
i
see
it
no
use
for
me
to
try
to
learn
to
do
right
a
body
that
get
started
right
when
little
got
no
show
when
the
pinch
comes
there
nothing
to
back
him
up
and
keep
him
to
his
work
and
so
he
gets
beat
then
i
thought
a
minute
and
says
to
myself
hold
on
a
done
right
and
give
jim
up
would
you
felt
better
than
what
you
do
now
no
says
i
feel
bad
feel
just
the
same
way
i
do
now
well
then
says
i
the
use
you
learning
to
do
right
when
troublesome
to
do
right
and
no
trouble
to
do
wrong
and
the
wages
is
just
the
same
i
was
stuck
i
answer
that
so
i
reckoned
i
bother
no
more
about
it
but
after
this
always
do
whichever
come
handiest
at
the
time
i
went
into
the
wigwam
jim
there
i
looked
all
around
he
anywhere
i
says
jim
here
i
is
huck
is
dey
out
sight
yit
talk
loud
he
was
in
the
river
under
the
stern
oar
with
just
his
nose
out
i
told
him
they
were
out
of
sight
so
he
come
aboard
he
says
i
was
to
all
de
talk
en
i
slips
into
de
river
en
was
gwyne
to
shove
for
if
dey
come
aboard
den
i
was
gwyne
to
swim
to
de
agin
when
dey
was
gone
but
lawsy
how
you
did
fool
huck
dat
wuz
de
dodge
i
tell
you
chile
it
ole
jim
ole
jim
going
to
forgit
you
for
dat
honey
then
we
talked
about
the
money
it
was
a
pretty
good
raise
twenty
dollars
apiece
jim
said
we
could
take
deck
passage
on
a
steamboat
now
and
the
money
would
last
us
as
far
as
we
wanted
to
go
in
the
free
states
he
said
twenty
mile
more
far
for
the
raft
to
go
but
he
wished
we
was
already
there
towards
daybreak
we
tied
up
and
jim
was
mighty
particular
about
hiding
the
raft
good
then
he
worked
all
day
fixing
things
in
bundles
and
getting
all
ready
to
quit
rafting
that
night
about
ten
we
hove
in
sight
of
the
lights
of
a
town
away
down
in
a
bend
i
went
off
in
the
canoe
to
ask
about
it
pretty
soon
i
found
a
man
out
in
the
river
with
a
skiff
setting
a
i
ranged
up
and
says
mister
is
that
town
cairo
cairo
no
you
must
be
a
fool
what
town
is
it
mister
if
you
want
to
know
go
and
find
out
if
you
stay
here
around
me
for
about
a
half
a
minute
longer
get
something
you
want
i
paddled
to
the
raft
jim
was
awful
disappointed
but
i
said
never
mind
cairo
would
be
the
next
place
i
reckoned
we
passed
another
town
before
daylight
and
i
was
going
out
again
but
it
was
high
ground
so
i
go
no
high
ground
about
cairo
jim
said
i
had
forgot
it
we
laid
up
for
the
day
on
a
towhead
tolerable
close
to
the
bank
i
begun
to
suspicion
something
so
did
jim
i
says
maybe
we
went
by
cairo
in
the
fog
that
night
he
says
talk
about
it
huck
niggers
have
no
luck
i
awluz
dat
done
wid
its
work
i
wish
never
seen
that
jim
i
do
wish
never
laid
eyes
on
it
it
fault
huck
you
know
you
blame
it
when
it
was
daylight
here
was
the
clear
ohio
water
inshore
sure
enough
and
outside
was
the
old
regular
muddy
so
it
was
all
up
with
cairo
we
talked
it
all
over
it
do
to
take
to
the
shore
we
take
the
raft
up
the
stream
of
course
there
no
way
but
to
wait
for
dark
and
start
back
in
the
canoe
and
take
the
chances
so
we
slept
all
day
amongst
the
cottonwood
thicket
so
as
to
be
fresh
for
the
work
and
when
we
went
back
to
the
raft
about
dark
the
canoe
was
gone
we
say
a
word
for
a
good
while
there
anything
to
say
we
both
knowed
well
enough
it
was
some
more
work
of
the
so
what
was
the
use
to
talk
about
it
it
would
only
look
like
we
was
finding
fault
and
that
would
be
bound
to
fetch
more
bad
luck
and
keep
on
fetching
it
too
till
we
knowed
enough
to
keep
still
by
and
by
we
talked
about
what
we
better
do
and
found
there
no
way
but
just
to
go
along
down
with
the
raft
till
we
got
a
chance
to
buy
a
canoe
to
go
back
in
we
going
to
borrow
it
when
there
anybody
around
the
way
pap
would
do
for
that
might
set
people
after
us
so
we
shoved
out
after
dark
on
the
raft
anybody
that
believe
yet
that
foolishness
to
handle
a
after
all
that
that
done
for
us
will
believe
it
now
if
they
read
on
and
see
what
more
it
done
for
us
the
place
to
buy
canoes
is
off
of
rafts
laying
up
at
shore
but
we
see
no
rafts
laying
up
so
we
went
along
during
three
hours
and
more
well
the
night
got
gray
and
ruther
thick
which
is
the
next
meanest
thing
to
fog
you
tell
the
shape
of
the
river
and
you
see
no
distance
it
got
to
be
very
late
and
still
and
then
along
comes
a
steamboat
up
the
river
we
lit
the
lantern
and
judged
she
would
see
it
boats
generly
come
close
to
us
they
go
out
and
follow
the
bars
and
hunt
for
easy
water
under
the
reefs
but
nights
like
this
they
bull
right
up
the
channel
against
the
whole
river
we
could
hear
her
pounding
along
but
we
see
her
good
till
she
was
close
she
aimed
right
for
us
often
they
do
that
and
try
to
see
how
close
they
can
come
without
touching
sometimes
the
wheel
bites
off
a
sweep
and
then
the
pilot
sticks
his
head
out
and
laughs
and
thinks
mighty
smart
well
here
she
comes
and
we
said
she
was
going
to
try
and
shave
us
but
she
seem
to
be
sheering
off
a
bit
she
was
a
big
one
and
she
was
coming
in
a
hurry
too
looking
like
a
black
cloud
with
rows
of
around
it
but
all
of
a
sudden
she
bulged
out
big
and
scary
with
a
long
row
of
furnace
doors
shining
like
teeth
and
her
monstrous
bows
and
guards
hanging
right
over
us
there
was
a
yell
at
us
and
a
jingling
of
bells
to
stop
the
engines
a
powwow
of
cussing
and
whistling
of
steam
and
as
jim
went
overboard
on
one
side
and
i
on
the
other
she
come
smashing
straight
through
the
raft
i
dived
and
i
aimed
to
find
the
bottom
too
for
a
wheel
had
got
to
go
over
me
and
i
wanted
it
to
have
plenty
of
room
i
could
always
stay
under
water
a
minute
this
time
i
reckon
i
stayed
under
a
minute
and
a
half
then
i
bounced
for
the
top
in
a
hurry
for
i
was
nearly
busting
i
popped
out
to
my
armpits
and
blowed
the
water
out
of
my
nose
and
puffed
a
bit
of
course
there
was
a
booming
current
and
of
course
that
boat
started
her
engines
again
ten
seconds
after
she
stopped
them
for
they
never
cared
much
for
raftsmen
so
now
she
was
churning
along
up
the
river
out
of
sight
in
the
thick
weather
though
i
could
hear
her
i
sung
out
for
jim
about
a
dozen
times
but
i
get
any
answer
so
i
grabbed
a
plank
that
touched
me
while
i
was
treading
water
and
struck
out
for
shore
shoving
it
ahead
of
me
but
i
made
out
to
see
that
the
drift
of
the
current
was
towards
the
shore
which
meant
that
i
was
in
a
crossing
so
i
changed
off
and
went
that

big
double

time
and

sound
only
i
thought
i
could
hear
my
heart
the
dogs
were
as
still
as
the
humans
but
they
followed
a
little
behind
me
when
i
got
to
the
three
log
doorsteps
i
heard
them
unlocking
and
unbarring
and
unbolting
i
put
my
hand

and
pushed
it
a
little
and
a
little
more
till
somebody

done
it
but
i
judged
they
would
take
it
off
the
candle
was
on
the
floor
and
there
they
all
was
looking
at
me
and
me
at
them
for
about
a
quarter
of
a
minute
three
big
men
with
guns
pointed
at
me
which
made
me
wince
i
tell
you
the
oldest
gray
and
about
sixty
the
other
two
thirty
or
more
all
of
them
fine
and
handsome
and
the
sweetest
old
lady
and
back
of
her
two
young
women
which
i
see
right
well
the
old
gentleman
says
there
i
reckon
all
right
come
in
as
soon
as
i
was
in
the
old
gentleman
he
locked
the
door
and
barred
it
and
bolted
it
and
told
the
young
men
to
come
in
with
their
guns
and
they
all
went
in
a
big
parlor
that
had
a
new
rag
carpet
on
the
floor
and
got
together
in
a
corner
that
was
out
of
the
range
of
the
front
windows
there
none
on
the
side
they
held
the
candle
and
took
a
good
look
at
me
and
all
said
why
he
a
shepherdson
no
there
any
shepherdson
about
him
then
the
old
man
said
he
hoped
i
mind
being
searched
for
arms
because
he
mean
no
harm
by
it
it
was
only
to
make
sure
so
he
pry
into
my
pockets
but
only
felt
outside
with
his
hands
and
said
it
was
all
right
he
told
me
to
make
myself
easy
and
at
home
and
tell
all
about
myself
but
the
old
lady
says
why
bless
you
saul

poor
as
wet
as
he
can
be
and
you
reckon

may
be
hungry

in
gaping

he
says
i
know

was
says
i
where

he
why
he
was
in
the
dark
where
he
was
well
if
you
knowed
where
he
was
what

you
ask
me
for
why

a
riddle
you

just
have
booming

you
own
a
dog

a
dog
and
go
in
the
river
and
bring
out
chips
that
you
throw
in
do
you
like
to
comb
up
sundays
and
all
that
kind
of
foolishness

i
but
ma
she
makes
me
confound
these
ole
britches
i
reckon
better
put
on
but
ruther
not
so
warm
are
you
all
ready
all
right
come
along
old
hoss
cold
cold
butter
and
buttermilk
that
is
what
they
had
for
me
down
there
and
there
nothing
better
that
ever
come
across
yet
buck
and
his
ma
and
all
of
them
smoked
cob
pipes
except
the
nigger
woman
which
was
gone
and
the
two
young
women
they
all
smoked
and
talked
and
i
eat
and
talked
the
young
women
had
quilts
around
them
and
their
hair
down
their
backs
they
all
asked
me
questions
and
i
told
them
how
pap
and
me
and
all
the
family
was
living
on
a
little
farm
down
at
the
bottom
of
arkansaw
and
my
sister
mary
ann
run
off
and
got
married
and
never
was
heard
of
no
more
and
bill
went
to
hunt
them
and
he
heard
of
no
more
and
tom
and
mort
died
and
then
there
nobody
but
just
me
and
pap
left
and
he
was
just
trimmed
down
to
nothing
on
account
of
his
troubles
so
when
he
died
i
took
what
there
was
left
because
the
farm
belong
to
us
and
started
up
the
river
deck
passage
and
fell
overboard
and
that
was
how
i
come
to
be
here
so
they
said
i
could
have
a
home
there
as
long
as
i
wanted
it
then
it
was
most
daylight
and
everybody
went
to
bed
and
i
went
to
bed
with
buck
and
when
i
waked
up
in
the
morning
drat
it
all
i
had
forgot
what
my
name
was
so
i
laid
there
about
an
hour
trying
to
think
and
when
buck
waked
up
i
says
can
you
spell
buck
yes
he
says
i
bet
you
spell
my
name
says
i
i
bet
you
what
you
dare
i
can
says
he
all
right
says
i
go
ahead
there
now
he
says
well
says
i
you
done
it
but
i
think
you
could
it
no
slouch
of
a
name
to
spell
right
off
without
studying
i
set
it
down
private
because
somebody
might
want
me
to
spell
it
next
and
so
i
wanted
to
be
handy
with
it
and
rattle
it
off
like
i
was
used
to
it
it
was
a
mighty
nice
family
and
a
mighty
nice
house
too
i
seen
no
house
out
in
the
country
before
that
was
so
nice
and
had
so
much
style
it
have
an
iron
latch
on
the
front
door
nor
a
wooden
one
with
a
buckskin
string
but
a
brass
knob
to
turn
the
same
as
houses
in
town
there
no
bed
in
the
parlor
nor
a
sign
of
a
bed
but
heaps
of
parlors
in
towns
has
beds
in
them
there
was
a
big
fireplace
that
was
bricked
on
the
bottom
and
the
bricks
was
kept
clean
and
red
by
pouring
water
on
them
and
scrubbing
them
with
another
brick
sometimes
they
wash
them
over
with
red
that
they
call
same
as
they
do
in
town
they
had
big
brass
that
could
hold
up
a
there
was
a
clock
on
the
middle
of
the
mantelpiece
with
a
picture
of
a
town
painted
on
the
bottom
half
of
the
glass
front
and
a
round
place
in
the
middle
of
it
for
the
sun
and
you
could
see
the
pendulum
swinging
behind
it
it
was
beautiful
to
hear
that
clock
tick
and
sometimes
when
one
of
these
peddlers
had
been
along
and
scoured
her
up
and
got
her
in
good
shape
she
would
start
in
and
strike
a
hundred
and
fifty
before
she
got
tuckered
out
they
took
any
money
for
her
well
there
was
a
big
outlandish
parrot
on
each
side
of
the
clock
made
out
of
something
like
chalk
and
painted
up
gaudy
by
one
of
the
parrots
was
a
cat
made
of
crockery
and
a
crockery
dog
by
the
other
and
when
you
pressed
down
on
them
they
squeaked
but
open
their
mouths
nor
look
different
nor
interested
they
squeaked
through
underneath
there
was
a
couple
of
big
fans
spread
out
behind
those
things
on
the
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
was
a
kind
of
a
lovely
crockery
basket
that
had
apples
and
oranges
and
peaches
and
grapes
piled
up
in
it
which
was
much
redder
and
yellower
and
prettier
than
real
ones
is
but
they
real
because
you
could
see
where
pieces
had
got
chipped
off
and
showed
the
white
chalk
or
whatever
it
was
underneath
this
table
had
a
cover
made
out
of
beautiful
oilcloth
with
a
red
and
blue
painted
on
it
and
a
painted
border
all
around
it
come
all
the
way
from
philadelphia
they
said
there
was
some
books
too
piled
up
perfectly
exact
on
each
corner
of
the
table
one
was
a
big
family
bible
full
of
pictures
one
was
progress
about
a
man
that
left
his
family
it
say
why
i
read
considerable
in
it
now
and
then
the
statements
was
interesting
but
tough
another
was
offering
full
of
beautiful
stuff
and
poetry
but
i
read
the
poetry
another
was
henry
speeches
and
another
was
dr
family
medicine
which
told
you
all
about
what
to
do
if
a
body
was
sick
or
dead
there
was
a
hymn
book
and
a
lot
of
other
books
and
there
was
nice
chairs
and
perfectly
sound
too
not
bagged
down
in
the
middle
and
busted
like
an
old
basket
they
had
pictures
hung
on
the
walls
mainly
washingtons
and
lafayettes
and
battles
and
highland
marys
and
one
called
signing
the
declaration
there
was
some
that
they
called
crayons
which
one
of
the
daughters
which
was
dead
made
her
own
self
when
she
was
only
fifteen
years
old
they
was
different
from
any
pictures
i
ever
see
before
blacker
mostly
than
is
common
one
was
a
woman
in
a
slim
black
dress
belted
small
under
the
armpits
with
bulges
like
a
cabbage
in
the
middle
of
the
sleeves
and
a
large
black
bonnet
with
a
black
veil
and
white
slim
ankles
crossed
about
with
black
tape
and
very
wee
black
slippers
like
a
chisel
and
she
was
leaning
pensive
on
a
tombstone
on
her
right
elbow
under
a
weeping
willow
and
her
other
hand
hanging
down
her
side
holding
a
white
handkerchief
and
a
reticule
and
underneath
the
picture
it
said
shall
i
never
see
thee
more
alas
another
one
was
a
young
lady
with
her
hair
all
combed
up
straight
to
the
top
of
her
head
and
knotted
there
in
front
of
a
comb
like
a
and
she
was
crying
into
a
handkerchief
and
had
a
dead
bird
laying
on
its
back
in
her
other
hand
with
its
heels
up
and
underneath
the
picture
it
said
i
shall
never
hear
thy
sweet
chirrup
more
alas
there
was
one
where
a
young
lady
was
at
a
window
looking
up
at
the
moon
and
tears
running
down
her
cheeks
and
she
had
an
open
letter
in
one
hand
with
black
sealing
wax
showing
on
one
edge
of
it
and
she
was
mashing
a
locket
with
a
chain
to
it
against
her
mouth
and
underneath
the
picture
it
said
and
art
thou
gone
yes
thou
art
gone
alas
these
was
all
nice
pictures
i
reckon
but
i
somehow
seem
to
take
to
them
because
if
ever
i
was
down
a
little
they
always
give
me
the
everybody
was
sorry
she
died
because
she
had
laid
out
a
lot
more
of
these
pictures
to
do
and
a
body
could
see
by
what
she
had
done
what
they
had
lost
but
i
reckoned
that
with
her
disposition
she
was
having
a
better
time
in
the
graveyard
she
was
at
work
on
what
they
said
was
her
greatest
picture
when
she
took
sick
and
every
day
and
every
night
it
was
her
prayer
to
be
allowed
to
live
till
she
got
it
done
but
she
never
got
the
chance
it
was
a
picture
of
a
young
woman
in
a
long
white
gown
standing
on
the
rail
of
a
bridge
all
ready
to
jump
off
with
her
hair
all
down
her
back
and
looking
up
to
the
moon
with
the
tears
running
down
her
face
and
she
had
two
arms
folded
across
her
breast
and
two
arms
stretched
out
in
front
and
two
more
reaching
up
towards
the
moon
and
the
idea
was
to
see
which
pair
would
look
best
and
then
scratch
out
all
the
other
arms
but
as
i
was
saying
she
died
before
she
got
her
mind
made
up
and
now
they
kept
this
picture
over
the
head
of
the
bed
in
her
room
and
every
time
her
birthday
come
they
hung
flowers
on
it
other
times
it
was
hid
with
a
little
curtain
the
young
woman
in
the
picture
had
a
kind
of
a
nice
sweet
face
but
there
was
so
many
arms
it
made
her
look
too
spidery
seemed
to
me
this
young
girl
kept
a
when
she
was
alive
and
used
to
paste
obituaries
and
accidents
and
cases
of
patient
suffering
in
it
out
of
the
presbyterian
observer
and
write
poetry
after
them
out
of
her
own
head
it
was
very
good
poetry
this
is
what
she
wrote
about
a
boy
by
the
name
of
stephen
dowling
bots
that
fell
down
a
well
and
was
drownded
ode
to
stephen
dowling
bots
and
did
young
stephen
sicken
and
did
young
stephen
die
and
did
the
sad
hearts
thicken
and
did
the
mourners
cry
no
such
was
not
the
fate
of
young
stephen
dowling
bots
though
sad
hearts
round
him
thickened
not
from
shots
no
did
rack
his
frame
nor
measles
drear
with
spots
not
these
impaired
the
sacred
name
of
stephen
dowling
bots
despised
love
struck
not
with
woe
that
head
of
curly
knots
nor
stomach
troubles
laid
him
low
young
stephen
dowling
bots
o
no
then
list
with
tearful
eye
whilst
i
his
fate
do
tell
his
soul
did
from
this
cold
world
fly
by
falling
down
a
well
they
got
him
out
and
emptied
him
alas
it
was
too
late
his
spirit
was
gone
for
to
sport
aloft
in
the
realms
of
the
good
and
great
if
emmeline
grangerford
could
make
poetry
like
that
before
she
was
fourteen
there
no
telling
what
she
could
a
done
by
and
by
buck
said
she
could
rattle
off
poetry
like
nothing
she
ever
have
to
stop
to
think
he
said
she
would
slap
down
a
line
and
if
she
find
anything
to
rhyme
with
it
would
just
scratch
it
out
and
slap
down
another
one
and
go
ahead
she
particular
she
could
write
about
anything
you
choose
to
give
her
to
write
about
just
so
it
was
sadful
every
time
a
man
died
or
a
woman
died
or
a
child
died
she
would
be
on
hand
with
her
tribute
before
he
was
cold
she
called
them
tributes
the
neighbors
said
it
was
the
doctor
first
then
emmeline
then
the
undertaker
the
undertaker
never
got
in
ahead
of
emmeline
but
once
and
then
she
hung
fire
on
a
rhyme
for
the
dead
name
which
was
whistler
she
ever
the
same
after
that
she
never
complained
but
she
kinder
pined
away
and
did
not
live
long
poor
thing
the
time
i
made
myself
go
up
to
the
little
room
that
used
to
be
hers
and
get
out
her
poor
old
and
read
in
it
when
her
pictures
had
been
aggravating
me
and
i
had
soured
on
her
a
little
i
liked
all
that
family
dead
ones
and
all
and
going
to
let
anything
come
between
us
poor
emmeline
made
poetry
about
all
the
dead
people
when
she
was
alive
and
it
seem
right
that
there
nobody
to
make
some
about
her
now
she
was
gone
so
i
tried
to
sweat
out
a
verse
or
two
myself
but
i
seem
to
make
it
go
somehow
they
kept
room
trim
and
nice
and
all
the
things
fixed
in
it
just
the
way
she
liked
to
have
them
when
she
was
alive
and
nobody
ever
slept
there
the
old
lady
took
care
of
the
room
herself
though
there
was
plenty
of
niggers
and
she
sewed
there
a
good
deal
and
read
her
bible
there
mostly
well
as
i
was
saying
about
the
parlor
there
was
beautiful
curtains
on
the
windows
white
with
pictures
painted
on
them
of
castles
with
vines
all
down
the
walls
and
cattle
coming
down
to
drink
there
was
a
little
old
piano
too
that
had
tin
pans
in
it
i
reckon
and
nothing
was
ever
so
lovely
as
to
hear
the
young
ladies
sing
the
last
link
is
broken
and
play
the
battle
of
prague
on
it
the
walls
of
all
the
rooms
was
plastered
and
most
had
carpets
on
the
floors
and
the
whole
house
was
whitewashed
on
the
outside
it
was
a
double
house
and
the
big
open
place
betwixt
them
was
roofed
and
floored
and
sometimes
the
table
was
set
there
in
the
middle
of
the
day
and
it
was
a
cool
comfortable
place
nothing
be
better
and
the
cooking
good
and
just
bushels
of
it
too
chapter
xviii
col
grangerford
was
a
gentleman
you
see
he
was
a
gentleman
all
over
and
so
was
his
family
he
was
well
born
as
the
saying
is
and
worth
as
much
in
a
man
as
it
is
in
a
horse
so
the
widow
douglas
said
and
nobody
ever
denied
that
she
was
of
the
first
aristocracy
in
our
town
and
pap
he
always
said
it
too
though
he
no
more
quality
than
a
mudcat
himself
col
grangerford
was
very
tall
and
very
slim
and
had
a
complexion
not
a
sign
of
red
in
it
anywheres
he
was
clean
shaved
every
morning
all
over
his
thin
face
and
he
had
the
thinnest
kind
of
lips
and
the
thinnest
kind
of
nostrils
and
a
high
nose
and
heavy
eyebrows
and
the
blackest
kind
of
eyes
sunk
so
deep
back
that
they
seemed
like
they
was
looking
out
of
caverns
at
you
as
you
may
say
his
forehead
was
high
and
his
hair
was
black
and
straight
and
hung
to
his
shoulders
his
hands
was
long
and
thin
and
every
day
of
his
life
he
put
on
a
clean
shirt
and
a
full
suit
from
head
to
foot
made
out
of
linen
so
white
it
hurt
your
eyes
to
look
at
it
and
on
sundays
he
wore
a
blue
with
brass
buttons
on
it
he
carried
a
mahogany
cane
with
a
silver
head
to
it
there
no
frivolishness
about
him
not
a
bit
and
he
ever
loud
he
was
as
kind
as
he
could
be
you
could
feel
that
you
know
and
so
you
had
confidence
sometimes
he
smiled
and
it
was
good
to
see
but
when
he
straightened
himself
up
like
a
and
the
lightning
begun
to
flicker
out
from
under
his
eyebrows
you
wanted
to
climb
a
tree
first
and
find
out
what
the
matter
was
afterwards
he
ever
have
to
tell
anybody
to
mind
their
manners
everybody
was
always
where
he
was
everybody
loved
to
have
him
around
too
he
was
sunshine
most
always
i
mean
he
made
it
seem
like
good
weather
when
he
turned
into
a
cloudbank
it
was
awful
dark
for
half
a
minute
and
that
was
enough
there
nothing
go
wrong
again
for
a
week
when
him
and
the
old
lady
come
down
in
the
morning
all
the
family
got
up
out
of
their
chairs
and
give
them
and
set
down
again
till
they
had
set
down
then
tom
and
bob
went
to
the
sideboard
where
the
decanter
was
and
mixed
a
glass
of
bitters
and
handed
it
to
him
and
he
held
it
in
his
hand
and
waited
till
and
was
mixed
and
then
they
bowed
and
said
our
duty
to
you
sir
and
madam
and
they
bowed
the
least
bit
in
the
world
and
said
thank
you
and
so
they
drank
all
three
and
bob
and
tom
poured
a
spoonful
of
water
on
the
sugar
and
the
mite
of
whisky
or
apple
brandy
in
the
bottom
of
their
tumblers
and
give
it
to
me
and
buck
and
we
drank
to
the
old
people
too
bob
was
the
oldest
and
tom
next
tall
beautiful
men
with
very
broad
shoulders
and
brown
faces
and
long
black
hair
and
black
eyes
they
dressed
in
white
linen
from
head
to
foot
like
the
old
gentleman
and
wore
broad
panama
hats
then
there
was
miss
charlotte
she
was
and
tall
and
proud
and
grand
but
as
good
as
she
could
be
when
she
stirred
up
but
when
she
was
she
had
a
look
that
would
make
you
wilt
in
your
tracks
like
her
father
she
was
beautiful
so
was
her
sister
miss
sophia
but
it
was
a
different
kind
she
was
gentle
and
sweet
like
a
dove
and
she
was
only
twenty
each
person
had
their
own
nigger
to
wait
on
them
buck
too
my
nigger
had
a
monstrous
easy
time
because
i
used
to
having
anybody
do
anything
for
me
but
was
on
the
jump
most
of
the
time
this
was
all
there
was
of
the
family
now
but
there
used
to
be
more
three
sons
they
got
killed
and
emmeline
that
died
the
old
gentleman
owned
a
lot
of
farms
and
over
a
hundred
niggers
sometimes
a
stack
of
people
would
come
there
horseback
from
ten
or
fifteen
mile
around
and
stay
five
or
six
days
and
have
such
junketings
round
about
and
on
the
river
and
dances
and
picnics
in
the
woods
daytimes
and
balls
at
the
house
nights
these
people
was
mostly
kinfolks
of
the
family
the
men
brought
their
guns
with
them
it
was
a
handsome
lot
of
quality
i
tell
you
there
was
another
clan
of
aristocracy
around
there
five
or
six
families
mostly
of
the
name
of
shepherdson
they
was
as
and
well
born
and
rich
and
grand
as
the
tribe
of
grangerfords
the
shepherdsons
and
grangerfords
used
the
same
steamboat
landing
which
was
about
two
mile
above
our
house
so
sometimes
when
i
went
up
there
with
a
lot
of
our
folks
i
used
to
see
a
lot
of
the
shepherdsons
there
on
their
fine
horses
one
day
buck
and
me
was
away
out
in
the
woods
hunting
and
heard
a
horse
coming
we
was
crossing
the
road
buck
says
quick
jump
for
the
woods
we
done
it
and
then
peeped
down
the
woods
through
the
leaves
pretty
soon
a
splendid
young
man
come
galloping
down
the
road
setting
his
horse
easy
and
looking
like
a
soldier
he
had
his
gun
across
his
pommel
i
had
seen
him
before
it
was
young
harney
shepherdson
i
heard
gun
go
off
at
my
ear
and
hat
tumbled
off
from
his
head
he
grabbed
his
gun
and
rode
straight
to
the
place
where
we
was
hid
but
we
wait
we
started
through
the
woods
on
a
run
the
woods
thick
so
i
looked
over
my
shoulder
to
dodge
the
bullet
and
twice
i
seen
harney
cover
buck
with
his
gun
and
then
he
rode
away
the
way
he
come
to
get
his
hat
i
reckon
but
i
see
we
never
stopped
running
till
we
got
home
the
old
eyes
blazed
a
minute
pleasure
mainly
i
judged
then
his
face
sort
of
smoothed
down
and
he
says
kind
of
gentle
i
like
that
shooting
from
behind
a
bush
why
you
step
into
the
road
my
boy
the
shepherdsons
father
they
always
take
advantage
miss
charlotte
she
held
her
head
up
like
a
queen
while
buck
was
telling
his
tale
and
her
nostrils
spread
and
her
eyes
snapped
the
two
young
men
looked
dark
but
never
said
nothing
miss
sophia
she
turned
pale
but
the
color
come
back
when
she
found
the
man
hurt
soon
as
i
could
get
buck
down
by
the
under
the
trees
by
ourselves
i
says
did
you
want
to
kill
him
buck
well
i
bet
i
did
what
did
he
do
to
you
him
he
never
done
nothing
to
me
well
then
what
did
you
want
to
kill
him
for
why
nothing
only
on
account
of
the
feud
a
feud
why
where
was
you
raised
you
know
what
a
feud
is
never
heard
of
it
before
tell
me
about
it
well
says
buck
a
feud
is
this
way
a
man
has
a
quarrel
with
another
man
and
kills
him
then
that
other
brother
kills
him
then
the
other
brothers
on
both
sides
goes
for
one
another
then
the
cousins
chip
in
and
by
and
by
killed
off
and
there
no
more
feud
but
kind
of
slow
and
takes
a
long
time
has
this
one
been
going
on
long
buck
well
i
should
reckon
it
started
thirty
year
ago
or
along
there
there
was
trouble
something
and
then
a
lawsuit
to
settle
it
and
the
suit
went
agin
one
of
the
men
and
so
he
up
and
shot
the
man
that
won
the
suit
which
he
would
naturally
do
of
course
anybody
would
what
was
the
trouble
about
buck
land
i
reckon
maybe
i
know
well
who
done
the
shooting
was
it
a
grangerford
or
a
shepherdson
laws
how
do
i
know
it
was
so
long
ago
anybody
know
oh
yes
pa
knows
i
reckon
and
some
of
the
other
old
people
but
they
know
now
what
the
row
was
about
in
the
first
place
has
there
been
many
killed
buck
yes
right
smart
chance
of
funerals
but
they
always
kill
got
a
few
buckshot
in
him
but
he
mind
it
he
weigh
much
anyway
been
carved
up
some
with
a
bowie
and
been
hurt
once
or
twice
has
anybody
been
killed
this
year
buck
yes
we
got
one
and
they
got
one
three
months
ago
my
cousin
bud
fourteen
year
old
was
riding
through
the
woods
on
side
of
the
river
and
have
no
weapon
with
him
which
was
foolishness
and
in
a
lonesome
place
he
hears
a
horse
behind
him
and
sees
old
baldy
shepherdson
after
him
with
his
gun
in
his
hand
and
his
white
hair
in
the
wind
and
of
jumping
off
and
taking
to
the
brush
bud
he
could
him
so
they
had
it
nip
and
tuck
for
five
mile
or
more
the
old
man
all
the
time
so
at
last
bud
seen
it
any
use
so
he
stopped
and
faced
around
so
as
to
have
the
bullet
holes
in
front
you
know
and
the
old
man
he
rode
up
and
shot
him
down
but
he
git
much
chance
to
enjoy
his
luck
for
inside
of
a
week
our
folks
laid
him
out
i
reckon
that
old
man
was
a
coward
buck
i
reckon
he
a
coward
not
by
a
sight
there
a
coward
amongst
them
shepherdsons
not
a
one
and
there
no
cowards
amongst
the
grangerfords
either
why
that
old
man
up
his
end
in
a
fight
one
day
for
half
an
hour
against
three
grangerfords
and
come
out
winner
they
was
all
he
lit
off
of
his
horse
and
got
behind
a
little
woodpile
and
his
horse
before
him
to
stop
the
bullets
but
the
grangerfords
stayed
on
their
horses
and
capered
around
the
old
man
and
peppered
away
at
him
and
he
peppered
away
at
them
him
and
his
horse
both
went
home
pretty
leaky
and
crippled
but
the
grangerfords
had
to
be
fetched
home
and
one
of
was
dead
and
another
died
the
next
day
no
sir
if
a
out
hunting
for
cowards
he
want
to
fool
away
any
time
amongst
them
shepherdsons
becuz
they
breed
any
of
that
kind
next
sunday
we
all
went
to
church
about
three
mile
everybody
the
men
took
their
guns
along
so
did
buck
and
kept
them
between
their
knees
or
stood
them
handy
against
the
wall
the
shepherdsons
done
the
same
it
was
pretty
ornery
preaching
all
about
brotherly
love
and
tiresomeness
but
everybody
said
it
was
a
good
sermon
and
they
all
talked
it
over
going
home
and
had
such
a
powerful
lot
to
say
about
faith
and
good
works
and
free
grace
and
preforeordestination
and
i
know
what
all
that
it
did
seem
to
me
to
be
one
of
the
roughest
sundays
i
had
run
across
yet
about
an
hour
after
dinner
everybody
was
dozing
around
some
in
their
chairs
and
some
in
their
rooms
and
it
got
to
be
pretty
dull
buck
and
a
dog
was
stretched
out
on
the
grass
in
the
sun
sound
asleep
i
went
up
to
our
room
and
judged
i
would
take
a
nap
myself
i
found
that
sweet
miss
sophia
standing
in
her
door
which
was
next
to
ours
and
she
took
me
in
her
room
and
shut
the
door
very
soft
and
asked
me
if
i
liked
her
and
i
said
i
did
and
she
asked
me
if
i
would
do
something
for
her
and
not
tell
anybody
and
i
said
i
would
then
she
said
forgot
her
testament
and
left
it
in
the
seat
at
church
between
two
other
books
and
would
i
slip
out
quiet
and
go
there
and
fetch
it
to
her
and
not
say
nothing
to
nobody
i
said
i
would
so
i
slid
out
and
slipped
off
up
the
road
and
there
anybody
at
the
church
except
maybe
a
hog
or
two
for
there
any
lock
on
the
door
and
hogs
likes
a
puncheon
floor
in
because
cool
if
you
notice
most
folks
go
to
church
only
when
got
to
but
a
hog
is
different
says
i
to
myself
up
it
natural
for
a
girl
to
be
in
such
a
sweat
about
a
testament
so
i
give
it
a
shake
and
out
drops
a
little
piece
of
paper
with
two
wrote
on
it
with
a
pencil
i
ransacked
it
but
find
anything
else
i
make
anything
out
of
that
so
i
put
the
paper
in
the
book
again
and
when
i
got
home
and
upstairs
there
was
miss
sophia
in
her
door
waiting
for
me
she
pulled
me
in
and
shut
the
door
then
she
looked
in
the
testament
till
she
found
the
paper
and
as
soon
as
she
read
it
she
looked
glad
and
before
a
body
could
think
she
grabbed
me
and
give
me
a
squeeze
and
said
i
was
the
best
boy
in
the
world
and
not
to
tell
anybody
she
was
mighty
red
in
the
face
for
a
minute
and
her
eyes
lighted
up
and
it
made
her
powerful
pretty
i
was
a
good
deal
astonished
but
when
i
got
my
breath
i
asked
her
what
the
paper
was
about
and
she
asked
me
if
i
had
read
it
and
i
said
no
and
she
asked
me
if
i
could
read
writing
and
i
told
her
no
only
and
then
she
said
the
paper
anything
but
a
to
keep
her
place
and
i
might
go
and
play
now
i
went
off
down
to
the
river
studying
over
this
thing
and
pretty
soon
i
noticed
that
my
nigger
was
following
along
behind
when
we
was
out
of
sight
of
the
house
he
looked
back
and
around
a
second
and
then
comes
and
says
mars
jawge
if
come
down
into
de
swamp
show
you
a
whole
stack
thinks
i
mighty
curious
he
said
that
yesterday
he
oughter
know
a
body
love
enough
to
go
around
hunting
for
them
what
is
he
up
to
anyway
so
i
says
all
right
trot
ahead
i
followed
a
half
a
mile
then
he
struck
out
over
the
swamp
and
waded
ankle
deep
as
much
as
another
we
come
to
a
little
flat
piece
of
land
which
was
dry
and
very
thick
with
trees
and
bushes
and
vines

says

few
steps

slopped
right
along
and
went
away
and
pretty
soon

trees

him
i
poked
into
the
place
and
come
to
a
little
open
patch

big
as

road
as
hard
as
i
could

by
and
by
i
begin
to
hear
guns
a
good
ways
off
when
i
came
in
sight
of
the
log
store
and
the
woodpile
where
the
steamboats
lands
i
worked
along
under
the
trees
and
brush
till
i
got
to
a
good
place
and
then
i
clumb
up
into
the
forks
of
a
cottonwood
that
was
out
of
reach
and
watched
there
was
a
four
foot
high
a
little
ways
in
front
of
the
tree
and
first
i
was
going
to
hide
behind
that
but
maybe
it
was
luckier
i
there
was
four
or
five
men
cavorting
around
on
their
horses
in
the
open
place
before
the
log
store
cussing
and
yelling
and
trying
to
get
at
a
couple
of
young
chaps
that
was
behind
the
alongside
of
the
steamboat
landing
but
they
come
it
every
time
one
of
them
showed
himself
on
the
river
side
of
the
woodpile
he
got
shot
at
the
two
boys
was
squatting
back
to
back
behind
the
pile
so
they
could
watch
both
ways
by
and
by
the
men
stopped
cavorting
around
and
yelling
they
started
riding
towards
the
store
then
up
gets
one
of
the
boys
draws
a
steady
bead
over
the
and
drops
one
of
them
out
of
his
saddle
all
the
men
jumped
off
of
their
horses
and
grabbed
the
hurt
one
and
started
to
carry
him
to
the
store
and
that
minute
the
two
boys
started
on
the
run
they
got
half
way
to
the
tree
i
was
in
before
the
men
noticed
then
the
men
see
them
and
jumped
on
their
horses
and
took
out
after
them
they
gained
on
the
boys
but
it
do
no
good
the
boys
had
too
good
a
start
they
got
to
the
woodpile
that
was
in
front
of
my
tree
and
slipped
in
behind
it
and
so
they
had
the
bulge
on
the
men
again
one
of
the
boys
was
buck
and
the
other
was
a
slim
young
chap
about
nineteen
years
old
the
men
ripped
around
awhile
and
then
rode
away
as
soon
as
they
was
out
of
sight
i
sung
out
to
buck
and
told
him
he
know
what
to
make
of
my
voice
coming
out
of
the
tree
at
first
he
was
awful
surprised
he
told
me
to
watch
out
sharp
and
let
him
know
when
the
men
come
in
sight
again
said
they
was
up
to
some
devilment
or
other
be
gone
long
i
wished
i
was
out
of
that
tree
but
i
come
down
buck
begun
to
cry
and
rip
and
that
him
and
his
cousin
joe
that
was
the
other
young
chap
would
make
up
for
this
day
yet
he
said
his
father
and
his
two
brothers
was
killed
and
two
or
three
of
the
enemy
said
the
shepherdsons
laid
for
them
in
ambush
buck
said
his
father
and
brothers
ought
to
waited
for
their
relations
the
shepherdsons
was
too
strong
for
them
i
asked
him
what
was
become
of
young
harney
and
miss
sophia
he
said
got
across
the
river
and
was
safe
i
was
glad
of
that
but
the
way
buck
did
take
on
because
he
manage
to
kill
harney
that
day
he
shot
at
him
i
ever
heard
anything
like
it
all
of
a
sudden
bang
bang
bang
goes
three
or
four
guns
the
men
had
slipped
around
through
the
woods
and
come
in
from
behind
without
their
horses
the
boys
jumped
for
the
river
both
of
them
hurt
and
as
they
swum
down
the
current
the
men
run
along
the
bank
shooting
at
them
and
singing
out
kill
them
kill
them
it
made
me
so
sick
i
most
fell
out
of
the
tree
i
to
tell
all
that
happened
it
would
make
me
sick
again
if
i
was
to
do
that
i
wished
i
ever
come
ashore
that
night
to
see
such
things
i
ever
going
to
get
shut
of
them
lots
of
times
i
dream
about
them
i
stayed
in
the
tree
till
it
begun
to
get
dark
afraid
to
come
down
sometimes
i
heard
guns
away
off
in
the
woods
and
twice
i
seen
little
gangs
of
men
gallop
past
the
log
store
with
guns
so
i
reckoned
the
trouble
was
still
on
i
was
mighty
downhearted
so
i
made
up
my
mind
i
ever
go
anear
that
house
again
because
i
reckoned
i
was
to
blame
somehow
i
judged
that
that
piece
of
paper
meant
that
miss
sophia
was
to
meet
harney
somewheres
at
two
and
run
off
and
i
judged
i
ought
to
told
her
father
about
that
paper
and
the
curious
way
she
acted
and
then
maybe
he
would
a
locked
her
up
and
this
awful
mess
ever
happened
when
i
got
down
out
of
the
tree
i
crept
along
down
the
river
bank
a
piece
and
found
the
two
bodies
laying
in
the
edge
of
the
water
and
tugged
at
them
till
i
got
them
ashore
then
i
covered
up
their
faces
and
got
away
as
quick
as
i
could
i
cried
a
little
when
i
was
covering
up
face
for
he
was
mighty
good
to
me
it
was
just
dark
now
i
never
went
near
the
house
but
struck
through
the
woods
and
made
for
the
swamp
jim
on
his
island
so
i
tramped
off
in
a
hurry
for
the
crick
and
crowded
through
the
willows
to
jump
aboard
and
get
out
of
that
awful
country
the
raft
was
gone
my
souls
but
i
was
scared
i
get
my
breath
for
most
a
minute
then
i
raised
a
yell
a
voice
not
foot
from
me
says
good
is
dat
you
honey
make
no
noise
it
was
voice
nothing
ever
sounded
so
good
before
i
run
along
the
bank
a
piece
and
got
aboard
and
jim
he
grabbed
me
and
hugged
me
he
was
so
glad
to
see
me
he
says
laws
bless
you
chile
i
right
down
dead
agin
been
heah
he
say
he
ben
shot
kase
you
come
home
no
so
dis
minute
a
de
down
towards
de
mouf
er
de
crick
to
be
all
ready
for
to
shove
out
en
leave
soon
as
jack
comes
agin
en
tells
me
for
certain
you
is
dead
lawsy
mighty
glad
to
git
you
back
again
honey
i
says
all
right
mighty
good
they
find
me
and
think
been
killed
and
floated
down
the
river
something
up
there
that
help
them
think
so
so
you
lose
no
time
jim
but
just
shove
off
for
the
big
water
as
fast
as
ever
you
can
i
never
felt
easy
till
the
raft
was
two
mile
below
there
and
out
in
the
middle
of
the
mississippi
then
we
hung
up
our
signal
lantern
and
judged
that
we
was
free
and
safe
once
more
i
had
a
bite
to
eat
since
yesterday
so
jim
he
got
out
some
and
buttermilk
and
pork
and
cabbage
and
greens
there
nothing
in
the
world
so
good
when
cooked
right
and
whilst
i
eat
my
supper
we
talked
and
had
a
good
time
i
was
powerful
glad
to
get
away
from
the
feuds
and
so
was
jim
to
get
away
from
the
swamp
we
said
there
no
home
like
a
raft
after
all
other
places
do
seem
so
cramped
up
and
smothery
but
a
raft
you
feel
mighty
free
and
easy
and
comfortable
on
a
raft
chapter
xix
two
or
three
days
and
nights
went
by
i
reckon
i
might
say
they
swum
by
they
slid
along
so
quiet
and
smooth
and
lovely
here
is
the
way
we
put
in
the
time
it
was
a
monstrous
big
river
down
there
sometimes
a
mile
and
a
half
wide
we
run
nights
and
laid
up
and
hid
daytimes
soon
as
night
was
most
gone
we
stopped
navigating
and
tied
up
nearly
always
in
the
dead
water
under
a
towhead
and
then
cut
young
cottonwoods
and
willows
and
hid
the
raft
with
them
then
we
set
out
the
lines
next
we
slid
into
the
river
and
had
a
swim
so
as
to
freshen
up
and
cool
off
then
we
set
down
on
the
sandy
bottom
where
the
water
was
about
knee
deep
and
watched
the
daylight
come
not
a
sound
anywheres
perfectly
still
just
like
the
whole
world
was
asleep
only
sometimes
the
bullfrogs
maybe
the
first
thing
to
see
looking
away
over
the
water
was
a
kind
of
dull
line
that
was
the
woods
on
side
you
make
nothing
else
out
then
a
pale
place
in
the
sky
then
more
paleness
spreading
around
then
the
river
softened
up
away
off
and
black
any
more
but
gray
you
could
see
little
dark
spots
drifting
along
ever
so
far
away
trading
scows
and
such
things
and
long
black
streaks
rafts
sometimes
you
could
hear
a
sweep
screaking
or
jumbled
up
voices
it
was
so
still
and
sounds
come
so
far
and
by
and
by
you
could
see
a
streak
on
the
water
which
you
know
by
the
look
of
the
streak
that
a
snag
there
in
a
swift
current
which
breaks
on
it
and
makes
that
streak
look
that
way
and
you
see
the
mist
curl
up
off
of
the
water
and
the
east
reddens
up
and
the
river
and
you
make
out
a
in
the
edge
of
the
woods
away
on
the
bank
on
side
of
the
river
being
a
woodyard
likely
and
piled
by
them
cheats
so
you
can
throw
a
dog
through
it
anywheres
then
the
nice
breeze
springs
up
and
comes
fanning
you
from
over
there
so
cool
and
fresh
and
sweet
to
smell
on
account
of
the
woods
and
the
flowers
but
sometimes
not
that
way
because
left
dead
fish
laying
around
gars
and
such
and
they
do
get
pretty
rank
and
next
got
the
full
day
and
everything
smiling
in
the
sun
and
the
just
going
it
a
little
smoke
be
noticed
now
so
we
would
take
some
fish
off
of
the
lines
and
cook
up
a
hot
breakfast
and
afterwards
we
would
watch
the
lonesomeness
of
the
river
and
kind
of
lazy
along
and
by
and
by
lazy
off
to
sleep
wake
up
by
and
by
and
look
to
see
what
done
it
and
maybe
see
a
steamboat
coughing
along
so
far
off
towards
the
other
side
you
tell
nothing
about
her
only
whether
she
was
a
or
then
for
about
an
hour
there
be
nothing
to
hear
nor
nothing
to
see
just
solid
lonesomeness
next
see
a
raft
sliding
by
away
off
yonder
and
maybe
a
galoot
on
it
chopping
because
most
always
doing
it
on
a
raft
see
the
axe
flash
and
come
down
you
hear
nothing
you
see
that
axe
go
up
again
and
by
the
time
above
the
head
then
you
hear
the
it
had
took
all
that
time
to
come
over
the
water
so
we
would
put
in
the
day
lazying
around
listening
to
the
stillness
once
there
was
a
thick
fog
and
the
rafts
and
things
that
went
by
was
beating
tin
pans
so
the
steamboats
run
over
them
a
scow
or
a
raft
went
by
so
close
we
could
hear
them
talking
and
cussing
and
laughing
heard
them
plain
but
we
see
no
sign
of
them
it
made
you
feel
crawly
it
was
like
spirits
carrying
on
that
way
in
the
air
jim
said
he
believed
it
was
spirits
but
i
says
no
spirits
say
the
dern
fog
soon
as
it
was
night
out
we
shoved
when
we
got
her
out
to
about
the
middle
we
let
her
alone
and
let
her
float
wherever
the
current
wanted
her
to
then
we
lit
the
pipes
and
dangled
our
legs
in
the
water
and
talked
about
all
kinds
of
things
we
was
always
naked
day
and
night
whenever
the
mosquitoes
would
let
us
the
new
clothes
folks
made
for
me
was
too
good
to
be
comfortable
and
besides
i
go
much
on
clothes
nohow
sometimes
have
that
whole
river
all
to
ourselves
for
the
longest
time
yonder
was
the
banks
and
the
islands
across
the
water
and
maybe
a
spark
which
was
a
candle
in
a
cabin
window
and
sometimes
on
the
water
you
could
see
a
spark
or
two
on
a
raft
or
a
scow
you
know
and
maybe
you
could
hear
a
fiddle
or
a
song
coming
over
from
one
of
them
crafts
lovely
to
live
on
a
raft
we
had
the
sky
up
there
all
speckled
with
stars
and
we
used
to
lay
on
our
backs
and
look
up
at
them
and
discuss
about
whether
they
was
made
or
only
just
happened
jim
he
allowed
they
was
made
but
i
allowed
they
happened
i
judged
it
would
have
took
too
long
to
make
so
many
jim
said
the
moon
could
a
laid
them
well
that
looked
kind
of
reasonable
so
i
say
nothing
against
it
because
seen
a
frog
lay
most
as
many
so
of
course
it
could
be
done
we
used
to
watch
the
stars
that
fell
too
and
see
them
streak
down
jim
allowed
got
spoiled
and
was
hove
out
of
the
nest
once
or
twice
of
a
night
we
would
see
a
steamboat
slipping
along
in
the
dark
and
now
and
then
she
would
belch
a
whole
world
of
sparks
up
out
of
her
chimbleys
and
they
would
rain
down
in
the
river
and
look
awful
pretty
then
she
would
turn
a
corner
and
her
lights
would
wink
out
and
her
powwow
shut
off
and
leave
the
river
still
again
and
by
and
by
her
waves
would
get
to
us
a
long
time
after
she
was
gone
and
joggle
the
raft
a
bit
and
after
that
you
hear
nothing
for
you
tell
how
long
except
maybe
frogs
or
something
after
midnight
the
people
on
shore
went
to
bed
and
then
for
two
or
three
hours
the
shores
was
black
no
more
sparks
in
the
cabin
windows
these
sparks
was
our
clock
the
first
one
that
showed
again
meant
morning
was
coming
so
we
hunted
a
place
to
hide
and
tie
up
right
away
one
morning
about
daybreak
i
found
a
canoe
and
crossed
over
a
chute
to
the
main
shore
it
was
only
two
hundred
yards
and
paddled
about
a
mile
up
a
crick
amongst
the
cypress
woods
to
see
if
i
get
some
berries
just
as
i
was
passing
a
place
where
a
kind
of
a
cowpath
crossed
the
crick
here
comes
a
couple
of
men
tearing
up
the
path
as
tight
as
they
could
foot
it
i
thought
i
was
a
goner
for
whenever
anybody
was
after
anybody
i
judged
it
was
me
or
maybe
jim
i
was
about
to
dig
out
from
there
in
a
hurry
but
they
was
pretty
close
to
me
then
and
sung
out
and
begged
me
to
save
their
lives
said
they
been
doing
nothing
and
was
being
chased
for
it
said
there
was
men
and
dogs
they
wanted
to
jump
right
in
but
i
says
you
do
it
i
hear
the
dogs
and
horses
yet
got
time
to
crowd
through
the
brush
and
get
up
the
crick
a
little
ways
then
you
take
to
the
water
and
wade
down
to
me
and
get
in
throw
the
dogs
off
the
scent
they
done
it
and
soon
as
they
was
aboard
i
lit
out
for
our
towhead
and
in
about
five
or
ten
minutes
we
heard
the
dogs
and
the
men
away
off
shouting
we
heard
them
come
along
towards
the
crick
but
see
them
they
seemed
to
stop
and
fool
around
a
while
then
as
we
got
further
and
further
away
all
the
time
we
hardly
hear
them
at
all
by
the
time
we
had
left
a
mile
of
woods
behind
us
and
struck
the
river
everything
was
quiet
and
we
paddled
over
to
the
towhead
and
hid
in
the
cottonwoods
and
was
safe
one
of
these
fellows
was
about
seventy
or
upwards
and
had
a
bald
head
and
very
gray
whiskers
he
had
an
old
slouch
hat
on
and
a
greasy
blue
woollen
shirt
and
ragged
old
blue
jeans
britches
stuffed
into
his
and
galluses
no
he
only
had
one
he
had
an
old
blue
jeans
coat
with
slick
brass
buttons
flung
over
his
arm
and
both
of
them
had
big
fat
the
other
fellow
was
about
thirty
and
dressed
about
as
ornery
after
breakfast
we
all
laid
off
and
talked
and
the
first
thing
that
come
out
was
that
these
chaps
know
one
another
what
got
you
into
trouble
says
the
baldhead
to
chap
well

selling
an
article
to
take
the
tartar
off
the
teeth
and
it
does
take
it
off
too

generly
the
enamel
along
with
it
but
i
stayed
about
one
night
longer
than
i
ought
to
and
was
just
in
the
act
of
sliding
out
when
i
ran
across
you
on
the
trail
this
side
of
town
and
you
told
me
they
were
coming
and
begged
me
to
help
you
to
get
off

i
told
you

bugged
out
when

and
i
reckon

too
then
the
baldhead
says
no
you
mean
it
yes
my
eldest
son
of
the
duke
of
bridgewater
fled
to
this
country
about
the
end
of
the
last
century
to
breathe
the
pure
air
of
freedom
married
here
and
died
leaving
a
son
his
own
father
dying
about
the
same
time
the
second
son
of
the
late
duke
seized
the
titles
and
estates
the
infant
real
duke
was
ignored
i
am
the
lineal
descendant
of
that
infant
i
am
the
rightful
duke
of
bridgewater
and
here
am
i
forlorn
torn
from
my
high
estate
hunted
of
men
despised
by
the
cold
world
ragged
worn
and
degraded
to
the
companionship
of
felons
on
a
raft
jim
pitied
him
ever
so
much
and
so
did
i
we
tried
to
comfort
him
but
he
said
it
much
use
he
be
much
comforted
said
if
we
was
a
mind
to
acknowledge
him
that
would
do
him
more
good
than
most
anything
else
so
we
said
we
would
if
he
would
tell
us
how
he
said
we
ought
to
bow
when
we
spoke
to
him
and
say
your
grace
or
my
lord
or
your
lordship
and
he
mind
it
if
we
called
him
plain
bridgewater
which
he
said
was
a
title
anyway
and
not
a
name
and
one
of
us
ought
to
wait
on
him
at
dinner
and
do
any
little
thing
for
him
he
wanted
done
well
that
was
all
easy
so
we
done
it
all
through
dinner
jim
stood
around
and
waited
on
him
and
says
will
grace
have
some
dis
or
some
dat
and
so
on
and
a
body
could
see
it
was
mighty
pleasing
to
him
but
the
old
man
got
pretty
silent
by
and
by
have
much
to
say
and
look
pretty
comfortable
over
all
that
petting
that
was
going
on
around
that
duke
he
seemed
to
have
something
on
his
mind
so
along
in
the
afternoon
he
says
looky
here
bilgewater
he
says
nation
sorry
